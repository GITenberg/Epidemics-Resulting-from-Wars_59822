  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTORY NOTE BY THE DIRECTOR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The Division of Economics and History of the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace is organized to ‘promote
a thorough and scientific investigation of the causes and
results of war.’ In accordance with this purpose a conference
of eminent statesmen, publicists, and economists was held
in Berne, Switzerland, in August 1911, at which a plan of
investigation was formed and an extensive list of topics was
prepared. The programme of that Conference is presented
in detail in an Appendix. It will be seen that an elaborate
series of investigations has been undertaken, and the resulting
reports may in due time be expected in printed form.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of works so prepared some will aim to reveal direct and
indirect consequences of warfare, and thus to furnish a basis
for a judgement as to the reasonableness of the resort to it.
If the evils are in reality larger and the benefits smaller than
in the common view they appear to be, such studies should
furnish convincing evidence of this fact and afford a basis
for an enlightened policy whenever there is danger of international
conflicts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Studies of the causes of warfare will reveal, in particular,
those economic influences which in time of peace bring about
clashing interests and mutual suspicion and hostility. They
will, it is believed, show what policies, as adopted by different
nations, will reduce the conflicts of interest, inure to the
common benefit, and afford a basis for international confidence
and good will. They will further reveal the natural
economic influences which of themselves bring about more
and more harmonious relations and tend to substitute
general benefits for the mutual injuries that follow unintelligent
self-seeking. Economic internationalism needs to be
fortified by the mutual trust that just dealing creates; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>just conduct itself may be favoured by economic conditions.
These, in turn, may be created partly by a natural evolution
and partly by the conscious action of governments; and
both evolution and public action are among the important
subjects of investigation.</p>

<p class='c007'>An appeal to reason is in order when excited feelings render
armed conflicts imminent; but it is quite as surely called
for when no excitement exists and when it may be forestalled
and prevented from developing by sound national policies.
To furnish a scientific basis for reasonable international
policies is the purpose of some of the studies already in progress
and of more that will hereafter be undertaken.</p>

<p class='c007'>The publications of the Division of Economics and History
are under the direction of a Committee of Research, the
membership of which includes the statesmen, publicists, and
economists who participated in the Conference at Berne in
1911, and two who have since been added. The list of
members at present is as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Eugène Borel</span>, Professor of Public and International Law
in the University of Geneva.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lujo Brentano</span>, Professor of Economics in the University
of Munich; Member of the Royal Bavarian Academy of
Sciences.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Charles Gide</span>, Professor of Comparative Social Economics
in the University of Paris.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>H. B. Greven</span>, Professor of Political Economy and
Statistics in the University of Leiden.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Francis W. Hirst</span>, Editor of <cite>The Economist</cite>, London.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>David Kinley</span>, Vice-President of the University of Illinois.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Henri La Fontaine</span>, Senator of Belgium.</p>

<p class='c007'>His Excellency <span class='sc'>Luigi Luzzatti</span>, Professor of Constitutional
Law in the University of Rome; Secretary of the
Treasury, 1891–3; Prime Minister of Italy, 1908–11.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Gotaro Ogawa</span>, Professor of Finance at the University
of Kioto, Japan.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir <span class='sc'>George Paish</span>, Joint Editor of <cite>The Statist</cite>, London.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span><span class='sc'>Maffeo Pantaleoni</span>, Professor of Political Economy in
the University of Rome.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Eugen Philippovich von Philippsberg</span>, Professor of
Political Economy in the University of Vienna; Member
of the Austrian Herrenhaus, Hofrat.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Paul S. Reinsch</span>, United States Minister to China.</p>

<p class='c007'>His Excellency <span class='sc'>Baron Y. Sakatani</span>, recently Minister of
Finance; Present Mayor of Tokio.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Theodor Schiemann</span>, Professor of the History of Eastern
Europe in the University of Berlin.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Harald Westergaard</span>, Professor of Political Science and
Statistics in the University of Copenhagen.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Friedrich, Freiherr von Wieser</span>, Professor of Political
Economy at the University of Vienna.</p>

<p class='c007'>The function of members of this Committee is to select
collaborators competent to conduct investigations and present
reports in the form of books or monographs; to consult with
these writers as to plans of study; to read the completed
manuscripts, and to inform the officers of the Endowment
whether they merit publication in its series. This editorial
function does not commit the members of the Committee to
any opinions expressed by the writers. Like other editors,
they are asked to vouch for the usefulness of the works, their
scientific and literary merit, and the advisability of issuing
them. In like manner, the publication of the monographs
does not commit the Endowment as a body or any of its
officers to the opinions which may be expressed in them.
The standing and attainments of the writers selected afford
a guarantee of thoroughness of research and accuracy in the
statement of facts, and the character of many of the works
will be such that facts, statistical, historical, and descriptive,
will constitute nearly the whole of their content. In so far as
the opinions of the writers are revealed, they are neither
approved nor condemned by the fact that the Endowment
causes them to be published. For example, the publication
of a work describing the attitude of various socialistic bodies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>on the subject of peace and war implies nothing as to the
views of the officers of the Endowment on the subject of
socialism; neither will the issuing of a work, describing the
attitude of business classes toward peace and war, imply any
agreement or disagreement on the part of the officers of the
Endowment with the views of men of these classes as to
a protective policy, the control of monopoly, or the regulation
of banking and currency. It is necessary to know how such
men generally think and feel on the great issue of war, and it
is one of the purposes of the Endowment to promote studies
which will accurately reveal their attitude. Neither it nor
its Committee of Research vouches for more than that the
works issued by them contain such facts; that their statements
concerning them may generally be trusted, and that
the works are, in a scientific way, of a quality that entitles
them to a reading.</p>

<p class='c007'>This monograph on epidemics resulting from wars is
designed to bring into light an aspect of international conflict
that has never been adequately appreciated. An examination
of the facts here presented will indicate that until comparatively
recent times the most serious human cost of war
has been not losses in the field, nor even the losses from
disease in the armies, but the losses from epidemics disseminated
among the civil populations. It was the war epidemics
and their sequelae, rather than direct military losses, that
accounted for the deep prostration of Germany after the
Thirty Years’ War. Such epidemics were also the gravest
consequence of the Napoleonic Wars.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may appear that a study of war epidemics can have
only historical interest, in view of the progress of modern
medical science. Plague, cholera, and typhus can be brought
under control by modern methods of sanitation. One can
point to the fact that in the present great war, the only
serious epidemic that has been reported is the typhus fever
epidemic in Serbia. When the medical history of the war
comes to be written, however, it will be found that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>aggregate losses from sporadic outbreaks of war epidemics
have been very considerable. A war sufficiently protracted
to lead to universal impoverishment and a breakdown of
medical organization would be attended, as in earlier times,
by the whole series of devastating war epidemics. And even
in the case of less exhausting wars, the chances of widespread
epidemics is far from negligible. There is much food for
reflection in the author’s account of the small-pox epidemic
following the Franco-German War. In 1870 the means of
coping with small-pox were as nearly perfect as they are
in the greater part of the world to-day. This fact did not
save Europe from a widespread epidemic, entailing human
losses exceeding in gravity the losses in the field. To-day,
as in the past, the probabilities of increased morbidity in
the civil population, not only among the belligerents, but
among neutrals as well, must be entered as a highly important
debit item against war.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In countries which have the misfortune to be the scene
of protracted wars, the mortality regularly undergoes a considerable
increase. This is caused chiefly by the infectious
diseases which in war times so often appear in the form of
epidemics. These diseases, moreover, not only afflict the
country in which the war is waged, but are also carried by
prisoners, returning soldiers, and in other ways, into the land
of the victor, where it is possible for them to spread over
a large territory. A report on the loss of human life among
that part of a population which does not participate in
a war has not yet been undertaken, writings on war pestilences
usually confining themselves to the losses within the
armies themselves.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c011'><sup>[1]</sup></a> It is the purpose of the present study
to investigate the losses sustained by the non-belligerent part
of the population in consequence of epidemics caused by wars.</p>

<p class='c007'>In doing this it seems advisable to select a few war
pestilences which on account of their enormous extent are
particularly notable, and to subject them to an exhaustive
discussion. This method has the advantage that it will
enable us to show in individual cases how it is possible for
these pestilences to extend over such a vast territory, under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>what circumstances they spread from place to place, and how
they enter regions remote from the scene of war. For this
exhaustive discussion the writer has chosen the pestilences
that occurred during the Thirty Years’ War, the epidemic
of typhus fever after Napoleon’s Russian Campaign, and the
pandemic of small-pox after the Franco-German War of
1870–1. These epidemics afford very instructive examples
of what horrible losses both friends and enemies may sustain
in consequence of war pestilences.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the outbreaks of ‘plague’ in the course of the
Thirty Years’ War have already been made the subject of
a comprehensive account, strange to say there are no such
accounts of the other two epidemics; to give a clear picture
of these pestilences the writer was therefore constrained to
collect the necessary information from widely dispersed
sources. In gathering his material a number of large German
libraries assisted him most kindly—particularly, the Royal
National Library at Stuttgart and the University libraries
of Strassburg and Tübingen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other parts of the history of war pestilences are set
forth in a more general way; for an exhaustive treatment
of them would have necessitated several years of preliminary
work, which the writer in the short time at his disposal was
unable to undertake.</p>

<p class='c007'>The writer has drawn as much as possible from original
sources; this applies at least to the pestilences of the
Napoleonic Period, and to the epidemic of small-pox after
the Franco-German War. It would have been impossible
to deal with the other wars in the same way without consuming
considerable time. From the bibliographies it will appear
what sources the author has consulted; rarely are quotations
given from works which he has not seen, and in such cases
it is indicated whence they were taken.</p>

<p class='c007'>The causes of the origin and spread of pestilences during
a war are clear. Every aggregation of people, even in times
of peace, at celebrations and annual fairs, in barracks, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>so forth, is necessarily exposed to the danger of pestilence;
but this danger is ten times as great in large assemblages
of troops during a war. The soldiers are then subjected to
all possible kinds of hardship and suffering—lack of food,
or food which is inferior and badly cooked, sleeping out in
the cold and rain, fatiguing marches, constant excitement,
and homesickness—and all these things greatly lessen their
power of resistance. When large bodies of troops are obliged
to remain in one and the same place for a considerable
length of time, the additional difficulty presents itself of
keeping the locality unpolluted by the excrement of men
and animals, and by refuse of all kinds. If an infectious
disease reveals its presence in such an aggregation of people,
energetic and stringent measures must be adopted, even in
times of peace, to prevent it from spreading. In war times
it is often impossible to take the necessary precautions,
since the attention of the commanders is directed toward
very definite objects, to which all other considerations are
subordinate. Whether the germ of the disease is already
in the place, or whether the soldiers bring it with them, in
either case there is danger that the fighting armies will
cause the disease to spread over the entire scene of the war,
and thus seriously endanger thousands of human lives.</p>

<p class='c007'>Modern methods of sanitation have done much toward
preventing the spread of army pestilences, not only in peace,
but also in war. The last few decades have evinced that
fact. Whatever attitude we may assume toward the question
whether war can ever be wholly abolished, we must all agree
that, if war has once broken out, all possible means must be
employed to prevent the spreading of pestilence within the
armies. Here the interests of the people and of the commanders
coincide, since the efficiency of armies is often
seriously interfered with by the outbreak of pestilence, and
not infrequently the success or failure of a war depends, not
upon the outcome of its battles, but upon the appearance or
non-appearance of pestilence.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER I<br /> <span class='large'>WAR PESTILENCES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>All infectious diseases may spread in consequence of
war and develop into epidemics of varying extent. In the
next chapter we shall see how the wars at the end of the
fifteenth century favoured the spread of an epidemic of
syphilis. In the Union Army, during the American Civil
War of 1861–5, both measles and typhoid fever were very
widespread, and together they were the cause of 4,246
deaths, or about 1·75 per cent of the total enlistment. Scarlet
fever, influenza, yellow fever, relapsing fever, and malaria
(if the war is waged in countries where this disease is endemic—especially
in the Lower Danube region, in the Netherlands,
Spain, and Italy) have also played an important rôle in many
wars. But we give the name ‘war pestilences’ only to
those infectious diseases which in the course of centuries
have usually followed at the heels of belligerent armies, such
as typhus fever, bubonic plague, cholera, typhoid fever,
dysentery, and small-pox; we may also include here scurvy,
the etiology of which has not yet been definitely determined.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <em>Typhus fever</em> (spotted fever, exanthematic typhus—called
in France and England simply typhus, in Spain
tabardillo<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c011'><sup>[2]</sup></a>—formerly called contagious typhus, hunger
typhus, camp fever, and Hungarian fever) is an acute
infectious disease of cyclic recurrence, which resembles
typhoid fever only in name. From the eighth to the tenth
day after infection, often somewhat sooner or later, it begins
with a chill, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, violent
headache, and psychic depression. In the first few days the
patient’s temperature rises rapidly, and on the fourth or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>fifth day a rash in the form of dull-red spots, as large as a pea,
breaks out over the entire body. These spots gradually
grow larger, and after two or three days, through the appearance
of very small haemorrhages, change into petechiae.
The apathy of which the patient first gave evidence now
gives way to wild delirium. At the end of the second week
the temperature falls rapidly, and in one or two days becomes
normal; often, however, the fall of temperature takes from
six to eight days. The duration of the entire disease, accordingly,
is from two to two and a half weeks. Death usually
occurs at the crisis of the disease—from the tenth to the
twelfth day—rarely between the sixth and ninth days or
after the twelfth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The danger of the disease varies greatly in different
epidemics; statements regarding this point diverge according
as we refer to the statistical records of hospitals or to the
private practice of physicians. With the latter the number
of deaths is smaller, since persons suffering from the disease
in mild form less often go to the hospitals. Epidemics in
which a quarter of the patients, and even more, have succumbed
have frequently occurred, especially in war times,
during famines, &amp;c. The cause (infective agent) of typhus
fever is not known; according to recent investigations it
is spread by vermin; Ricketts and others have fixed responsibility
for it upon the body louse. The infection is communicated
from man to man, and very often it is contracted
from the clothes, linen, and other effects of typhus patients.
Recovery from the disease usually renders a person immune
against a second attack. Typhus fever frequently appears
nowadays in the eastern and south-eastern parts of Europe,
in Hungary and Galicia, and also in Spain, Italy, and Ireland.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <em>Plague</em> appears in two forms, depending upon the place
where the infective agent enters the body: the bubonic
plague and the pneumonic plague. In the case of the former
the painful plague-sores (buboes) develop, usually two or
three days after infection, from the lymphatic glands; these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>sores,—which appear most often in the region of the groin,
less often in the axilla, on the neck, lower jaw, and in other
places,—soon suppurate. There is either a development of
toxins, which are the cause of the severe general symptoms,
or else the <em>bacilli pestis</em> go from the glands into the circulatory
system and cause septicaemia, which is quickly fatal. Pneumonic
plague takes the form of a catarrhal inflammation
of the lungs, causing a profuse and bloody expectoration,
which contains large quantities of bacilli. This form of the
disease almost always ends fatally in a few days. The
mortality of bubonic plague is somewhat lower; the disease
has an average duration of eight days, and carries away from
fifty to seventy per cent of its victims.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Middle Ages an epidemic of plague (black death)
ravaged all Europe. At the present time it is still endemic
in India, in southern China, in Egypt, in Uganda, and perhaps
in other countries, whence it frequently develops into general
epidemics.</p>

<p class='c007'>The infective agent in the case of plague is the <em>bacillus
pestis</em>, identified in 1894 by Kitasato, and subsequently, but
independently, by Yersin. Rats, which are very susceptible
to the disease, play an important rôle in spreading it; in
India the outbreak of a plague epidemic is always preceded
by the dying of large numbers of rats. Their excrement contains
large quantities of bacilli, which may be destructive to
human beings. The rat-flea is also known to carry the
infection. The infection may be conveyed directly by plague
patients, when the buboes suppurate, or when the blood
becomes generally infected with the <em>bacilli pestis</em>, which
are contained in abundance in the sputum, urine, and
excrement, or when the lungs are affected and the patient
charges the atmosphere by coughing. One who has recovered
from the disease is usually immune for life.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <em>Cholera</em>, after an incubation period of two to eight days,
begins with frequent (ten to twenty times a day) vomitings
of a fluid like rice-water, and incessant retching. The patient,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>owing to the great loss of water, sinks rapidly; he acquires
a corpse-like appearance, loses consciousness, and death may
result on the first or second day. If the attack is survived,
the patient frequently dies from sheer exhaustion afterwards.
The mortality of cholera is great—from forty to fifty per
cent of its victims die. In this calculation the numerous
cases of cholerine, that are always prevalent during cholera
times, are excluded. Recovery from the disease does not
protect a person against contracting it again. The infective
germ in the case of cholera is the ‘comma bacillus’, discovered
by Robert Koch in 1883. The spread of cholera
is caused by the penetration of the <em>comma bacillus</em> into the
alimentary canal, resulting from contact with objects which
have been contaminated by the evacuations of cholera
patients; less frequently it is indirectly caused by the
pollution, from evacuations, of water used for drinking or
washing purposes.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. <em>Dysentery</em> has always played an important rôle in
military campaigns. To be sure, it is not very dangerous,
so far as the patient’s life is concerned, but in war times,
owing to irregular nursing and scanty nourishment, and the
consequent use of unsuitable food, it may spread over a large
territory and be very destructive to large numbers of soldiers
and other people.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are two distinct forms of the disease—amoebic
dysentery and bacillary dysentery. The latter is caused
by the <em>bacillus pyocyaneus</em>, discovered independently by
Stiga, Kruse, and Flexner. The disease used to be common
throughout Europe; at the present time it appears in Central
and Western Europe only in small epidemics, whereas in
Eastern Europe it spreads over large territories. It causes
frequent, often blood-coloured, defecations, accompanied by
griping pains in the abdomen and a distressing pressure
(tenesmus). The disease lasts from one to one and a half
weeks, but for a long time after recovery the patient’s
alimentary canal is very sensitive to improper nourishment.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>The disease is transmitted either by direct contact, since the
evacuations of the bowels contain large quantities of bacilli,
or by infected water. Amoebic dysentery, occurring in
tropical countries (Southern Europe, Egypt, Southern Asia,
Central America, &amp;c.), is much more dangerous; it is caused
by an amoeba, carefully studied by Kartulis, and very often
acquires a chronic character, sometimes causing abscess of
the liver.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. <em>Typhoid fever</em> (called in England ‘enteric fever’, in
France ‘fièvre typhoïde’, in Italy ‘febbre tifoidea’) in
many wars has been very widespread among the armies; for
example, in the American Civil War, in the Franco-German
War (Metz), and in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–8.
The progress of the disease is well known; between the time
of infection and the outbreak of the sickness nine to eleven
days usually intervene, sometimes even as much as three
weeks. In the first week the temperature of the patient
rises slowly, during the second week it remains at about
the same height, while in the third week it abates considerably,
becoming normal in the course of the fourth week.
The spleen enlarges a great deal, and in the second week
small pale-red spots (roseola), scarcely as large as a pea,
appear on the buttocks and especially on the belly. The
patient’s bowel-movements, at first normal, now becomes
diarrhoeal, while certain psychic disorders also manifest
themselves, usually in the form of a heavy somnolence. In
the third week the patient’s life is threatened by complications
in the intestines—haemorrhage or perforation. Characteristic
of the disease are the anatomical changes of the small
intestine—at first enlargement, and later ulceration of
Peyer’s patches. The infective agent in the case of typhoid
fever is a bacillus, identified by Gaffky in 1882. It lodges in
the alimentary canal, and is conveyed by food that has been
touched with hands to which matter containing the bacillus
has adhered, or else in contaminated water used for drinking
or other purposes. From eight to ten per cent of the patients
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>die, while a single recovery usually insures immunity against
a second attack.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. <em>Small-pox</em> has an incubation period of ten to fourteen
days. The disease begins with a chill, accompanied by violent
headache. On the third day the eruption appears; little
papules develop and quickly change into pustules, showing
themselves first on the face, then on the back, arms, and hands,
and finally on the legs and feet. On the ninth day the
pustules suppurate, and after that gradually dry up; if it
progresses favourably, the disease is over in two or two and
a half weeks.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of small-pox the infective agent is not yet
known; infection is caused by contact with a patient, or
with objects which he is using or has used. It is particularly
dangerous to touch things on which the contents of the
pustules have dried, for such articles remain infectious for
a long time. Recovery from the disease usually renders
a person immune for life. The mortality in different epidemics
varies greatly; most dangerous of all is the so-called
‘black small-pox’ (haemorrhagic small-pox, with bleeding
in the pustules and under the skin). The total number of
deaths in an epidemic of small-pox is dependent upon whether
the disease appears in a vaccinated or an unvaccinated
community; in the latter case the mortality may reach
thirty per cent, whereas in the former case only three or
four per cent of the patients die. Vaccination renders a person
immune for eight to twelve years, while, if the disease
breaks out anywhere in spite of vaccination, the number of
fatal cases is very few. It should be noted that small-pox
was formerly dreaded, not only because of its danger to
life, but also because it frequently leaves a person disfigured
for life, and in rare instances causes total blindness.</p>

<p class='c007'>7. <em>Scorbutus</em> (scurvy) used to be a common disease on
ships, in prisons, and in times of famine; it appeared with
the greatest malignancy in besieged cities—Thorn, Nuremberg,
Alexandria, Port Arthur, &amp;c. The real cause of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>disease is unknown, although too much food of one kind,
particularly lack of fresh vegetables, together with long
confinement in poorly ventilated and dark rooms, are
important causative factors. Inasmuch as the disease almost
always appears in the form of an epidemic, it is probable
that there is a specific infective agent. It begins with a
general feeling of weakness; the skin and mucous membranes
become pale and sallow, the gums become inflamed and
ulcerated, and small and large extravasations of blood take
place in the skin and muscles, and at the joints and knuckles.
In serious cases haemorrhages occur in the intestines, kidneys,
bladder, and uterus. A change of diet and surroundings will
quickly cure scurvy; otherwise progressive anaemia will
result in death.</p>

<p class='c006'>Numerous as are the historical notices in former years
regarding the destruction of armies by pestilence, correspondingly
few are the detailed reports on the spread of
pestilence among the non-belligerent population. The best-known
example from antiquity is the <em>Plague of Athens</em>
(430–425 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>), described by Thucydides. The plague began
in the second year of the Peloponnesian War, a few days after
the invasion of the Peloponnesians. That it is famous is
due to the classical description of it by Thucydides, himself
a sufferer from the disease. The Plague of Athens broke out
in the Piraeus, a fact which has led to the inference that it
was borne thither by mariners from Egypt. At the time of
the invasion of the Peloponnesians, thousands of country
people fled to the city of Athens, which on the advice of
Pericles opened its gates to them; thus more than 400,000
people were crowded together within its walls. The first
outbreak of the plague lasted two years, then there was an
intermission of a year and a half, whereupon it commenced
anew. The second outbreak, according to Diodorus, carried
away 4,400 hoplites, 300 cavalrymen, a large (but uncertain)
number of other soldiers, and 10,000 women and slaves. The
plague also penetrated to other places, sparing, however,
the Peloponnesus. The nature of the sickness described by
Thucydides cannot be positively determined; it has been
referred to as bubonic plague (Sprengel), as small-pox
(Krause-Daremberg, Kobert), as typhus fever (Häser,
Kanngiesser), as typhoid fever (Seitz), and even as anthrax.
All we know for certain is that it was some highly infectious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>disease, recovery from which rendered a person immune.
Krauss and Hecker believe that it was a special disease
(‘antique plague’), which no longer occurs.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c011'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Plague of the Antonines</em>, also called the ‘Plague of
Galen’, which ravaged Italy in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 166–8, has also been
brought into connexion with warlike events. Avidius
Cassius, who preceded Verus in command of the army, had
been sent to Syria for the purpose of suppressing a rebellion,
and there, after the capture of Seleucia, the plague broke
out. It was borne by the troops back to Rome, where, after
the triumphal procession of 166, it spread far and wide, so
that it was necessary to load its victims on wagons and
carry them off for burial. The plague spread from Italy to
Gaul, to the very banks of the Rhine, and a large part of
the province was literally depopulated—decayed and deserted
villages were found everywhere. Häser inclines to the view
that it was an epidemic of small-pox, while Laveran, Hecker,
Krause, and Littré believe that it was neither small-pox nor
typhus fever, but ‘antique plague’.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c011'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The expeditions of the German emperors to Italy, as well
as the Crusades, offer numerous examples of how large armies
may be destroyed by disease. So, for instance, in 963 or 964
the army of the Emperor Otto I was attacked by a severe
pestilence in Italy—a murderous disease which was usually
fatal in twenty-four hours. The German army of Henry IV
in 1081–2, but especially after the capture of Rome on June 3,
1083, suffered from plagues in Italy; but the same army
fared even worse in 1084, when a plague broke out and
carried away, for example, the entire German garrison in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Rome. In 1137 Lothair’s army was likewise attacked by
infectious diseases in Italy. But by far the most devastating
of all was the pestilence which broke out in Rome in August,
1167, shortly after the capture of the city by Frederick
Barbarossa, and paved the way to a catastrophe which culminated
in the complete annihilation of the German army.
At that time many eminent men succumbed to the disease,
the army dwindled away in the hands of the leaders, and the
soldiers fled in vast numbers in order to escape certain death.
Even after the Emperor Barbarossa’s withdrawal from Rome
the pestilence continued to rage in his army, and it was a long
time before it disappeared from the city. It was the true
(bubonic) plague, and usually resulted fatally on the first
day. In the winter of 1190–1 a pestilence broke out in Lower
Italy in the army of Henry VI; it appeared at the beginning
of the siege of Naples and carried away many eminent men.
The king himself contracted the disease, and had to be taken
to Capua.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c011'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The armies of the Crusades fared even worse; the mortality
in the First Crusade, before and after the conquest of
Antioch (1097–8), was terrible. The pestilence is said to
have broken out first among the children and women who
accompanied the armies, and its dissemination was favoured
by a lack of sustenance and continual rainfall; from September
to the 24th of November the pestilence carried away
100,000. The nature of the disease is not known, although
it is known to have been very infectious. When a new army
of 1,500 Germans arrived, it was quickly attacked by the
disease and in a few days almost completely annihilated.
Several hundred frequently died in a single day, and as the
summer of 1099 was very hot and a number of bodies remained
unburied, the pestilence lasted well into that year. In 1100
another pestilence raged among the crusaders. Again, during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>the Second Crusade a severe epidemic broke out in the army
of the Emperor Louis VII at Attalia in Asia Minor; the pestilence
spread rapidly among the inhabitants of the city, so
that many houses, even entire streets, were depopulated.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c011'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>During the Third Crusade, shortly after the death of
Frederick Barbarossa (June, 1190), a severe pestilence broke
out in the army that was besieging Antioch; according to
Michaux only 5,000 infantrymen and 700 cavalrymen
survived out of the entire German army.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c011'><sup>[7]</sup></a> At the siege of
Acre (Ptolemais), which lasted from August 1189, to July
1191, there broke out in the winter of 1191 a terrible pestilence
which played havoc in the pilgrim army; it was caused by
an inadequate supply of food, and its symptoms (enlargement
of the limbs and falling out of the teeth) betoken scurvy.
It also appeared in the army of Saladin, but was much worse
in the Christian army, in which from 100 to 200 crusaders
died every day. Duke Frederick of Swabia succumbed to
this disease on January 20, 1191.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c011'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>At the time of the crusade against the heretics a serious
pestilence broke out in Egypt in the army of the crusaders,
which had already, on August 12, 1218, suffered from
dysentery; it appeared in December during the siege of
Damietta, after a heavy and continuous downfall of rain.
‘The patients’, says Wilken, ‘were suddenly seized with
violent pains in the feet and ankles; their gums became
swollen, their teeth loose and useless, while their hips and
shin bones first turned black and then putrefied. Finally,
an easy and peaceful death, like a gentle sleep, put an end
to their sufferings. A sixth of the pilgrim army was carried
away by this disease, which no medicine could cure.’<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c011'><sup>[9]</sup></a> Only
a few patients who survived the winter were helped to
recovery by the warmth of spring. It was unquestionably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>a severe form of scurvy. The besieged, too, suffered from
the destructive pestilence, and also from Egyptian ophthalmia.
We read further in Wilken: ‘A horrible sight greeted
the pilgrims when they took possession of Damietta. Not
only the houses, but even the streets were filled with unburied
corpses; in the beds dead bodies lay beside helpless and dying
invalids, and the infection of the air was intolerable. Of
80,000 inhabitants which the city had had at the beginning
of the siege only 3,000 were left, while only 100 of these were
healthy.’<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c011'><sup>[10]</sup></a> Other reports say that 10,000 inhabitants
survived.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1270, during the Seventh and last Crusade, which
strangely enough passed by way of Tunis, a pestilential
disease broke out in Carthage, carrying away, in addition to
many soldiers and men of rank, King Louis IX of France himself
and his son, Jean Tristan. This pestilence was dysentery,
and it spread even to Sicily, whither the king’s body was
conveyed. After the king’s death conditions were even worse,
since so many people died that it was impossible to bury all
the bodies. The disease also attacked the enemy’s army.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c011'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The increased prevalence of <em>leprosy</em> in Europe in the
Middle Ages is often attributed to the Crusades.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c011'><sup>[12]</sup></a> Leprosy
was very widespread in Germany, France, Italy, and other
countries of Europe before the Crusades; according to
Hirsch it appeared in the Roman Empire in the first century
before the birth of Christ, but did not become very prevalent
until later. Legal regulations governing the marrying of
lepers date back as far as the seventh century, while the
earliest reports regarding leper-houses come down from the
eighth and ninth centuries. Most leper-houses, however,
were built between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries,
and although the reverse opinion has been expressed, it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>nevertheless improbable that the building of these houses
was not due to the increased prevalence of the disease.
Inasmuch as leprosy was very widespread in the Orient,
where numerous crusaders contracted it, as indicated by
the fact that institutions were founded there for its victims,
many crusaders doubtless returned with the disease in their
systems. But regarding this matter we shall never have
absolutely reliable information; for it is assumed that many
people suffering from other chronic skin diseases were placed
in the leper-houses. A careful study of the available data,
however, leads us to believe that wrong diagnoses were not
so frequent as to account for the large number of cases of
leprosy in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries.
Admittance to leper-houses was regulated by many precautionary
measures, and the diagnosis of the disease was
made by churchmen, even bishops, who without doubt
necessarily acquired a good eye for the disease in the course
of time. Not until later, when we may be certain that
leprosy was no longer brought from the Orient, was the
disease probably now and then confused with syphilis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The notable pandemic outbreak of syphilis at the end of
the fifteenth century was also largely attributable to warlike
events. The rapid spread of the disease throughout Central
Europe was due, according to contemporary notices, to the
<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Landsknechte</span></i> (common foot-soldiers). The rough coincidence
of this epidemic with the discovery of America has given
rise to the view that the disease did not exist in Europe
at earlier periods, but was borne thither from America. But
we can point to numerous instances in the course of the last
century, of how infectious diseases, hitherto unknown, or
existing only sporadically, all of a sudden became pandemic
(cholera, plague, diphtheria, influenza), although no satisfactory
and comprehensive explanation of the phenomenon
has been offered. It is generally known that infectious
diseases break out in a mild form and last for years, and then
suddenly change their character and cause virulent epidemics;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>this is positively confirmed by the epidemic of small-pox in
1870–2, which will be discussed later. At all events we cannot
draw the conclusion from the sudden outbreak of an epidemic
of syphilis, that the disease was not present in Europe before.</p>

<p class='c007'>A serious epidemic of syphilis broke out in the army of
Charles VIII of France during his expedition to Naples.
Inasmuch as his advance was nowhere opposed, he was able
to enter Naples on February 12, 1495. There the French
army gave itself over to the most unbridled licentiousness,
and the result was that the disease spread rapidly in both
the French and Italian armies. Italians and Frenchmen
accused each other of having brought the disease, so that the
former called syphilis ‘French disease’ and the later ‘Neapolitan
disease’. The disbanding of Charles’s army caused
the disease to spread far and wide in Europe. ‘Those who
had most to do with the further dissemination of the disease,’
says Häser,<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c011'><sup>[13]</sup></a> ‘were the Albanian and Roumanian estradiots
serving in the Venetian army, brutal and rapacious adventurers,
and also the German and Swiss <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Landsknechte</span></i> returning
from Italy, who spread the disease over a large part of Europe.’</p>

<p class='c007'>A large number of writers of the beginning of the sixteenth
century bear witness to the fact that the pestilence was borne
into Germany by <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Landsknechte</span></i>; e.g. Pastor N. Berler
(<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ruffachische Chronik</span></cite> of 1510), Heinrich Brennwald (1519),
Johann Haselbergk (1533), Valentin Müntzer (1550), <cite>Nuremberg
Chronicle</cite> of 1580.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c011'><sup>[14]</sup></a> In the year 1495 the pestilence
broke out in many places in France and Germany; in
Strassburg, for example, the disease was planted by <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Landsknechte</span></i>
who had served in, and been discharged from, the
army of Charles VIII; Hans Schott testifies to this fact in
his <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Weltlich Leyenbuch</span></cite> (Strassburg, 1541). The city of Metz
tried in vain to ward off the disease; according to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span><cite>Metz Chronicle</cite>, many Burgundians (500 cavalrymen and 700
infantrymen) came to Metz in May 1495, and since the most
of them were suffering from <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mal de Naples</span></i>, they were not
allowed to enter the city. But the soldiers infected the women
in the vicinity, and the disease was later borne by them into
the city, where it prevailed for four years, not beginning
to abate until the year 1500.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c011'><sup>[15]</sup></a> We also have testimony to
the fact that the outbreak of the disease in Nördlingen (1495)
was caused by the arrival of <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Landsknechte</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a supplementary way we may add here that later wars
also caused frequent epidemics of syphilis within narrow
confines; instances of this kind are cited by A. Hirsch<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c011'><sup>[16]</sup></a> and
H. Schwiening.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c011'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In August of the year 1486 <em>English sweating-sickness</em>
appeared in England for the first time; it broke out among
the troops of Henry VII shortly before his victory at Bosworth
on August 22, 1486. And when Henry landed at Milford
the disease spread, carrying away many victims wherever
it went. ‘Strong and well-nourished people were particularly
susceptible to it—more so than old men, children, and poor
people. From three to nine, sometimes all the inmates of
a house caught it, and it gradually spread over half the
inhabitants of the town. The first appearance of the disease
is said to have caused more devastation in London (where it
broke out on September 21), Bedford, and Cambridge, than
the sword, which had been ruling for thirty years in a fearful
civil war. According to Forest, an incredible number of
people died from it, while Thomas Moore also speaks of the
dangerous character of this epidemic. In many places
a third of the inhabitants are said to have died from it,
scarcely one in a hundred of its victims recovering.’<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c011'><sup>[18]</sup></a> The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>subsequent appearance of the disease, especially the transplantation
of it to the continent in the year 1529, was not
attributable to warlike events. In the year 1551 it disappeared
as suddenly as it had appeared in 1486.</p>

<p class='c007'>The disease usually began with a chill, headache, palpitation
of the heart, difficulty in breathing, and later a profuse,
very malodorous emission of sweat from all parts of the body.
The patient quickly lapsed into a state of lethargy. The
progress of the disease was uncommonly rapid; ‘in one
day either the disease or the patient came to an end,’ says
Fracastorius. Any patient who did not succumb, recovered
completely after one or two weeks.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the sixteenth century on notices are more abundant;
we now hear of epidemics of typhus fever throughout all
Europe, although we do not know positively where the
disease first appeared. ‘At all times,’ says Hirsch,<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c011'><sup>[19]</sup></a> ‘as far
back as historical investigation is able to follow the course
of typhus fever at all, the disease has always been bound
up with the most dismal calamities of the nations. The
supposition is therefore justified that, in the numerous war-pestilences
and famine-pestilences of antiquity and the
Middle Ages, regarding which we have no medical reports
and must rely only upon the chronicles, typhus fever has
played a conspicuous rôle.’ By this, however, Hirsch does
not mean to say that the specific disease in all the so-called
war-pestilences was typhus fever; on the contrary, he adds:
‘In saying this I by no means wish to imply that I always
identify “war-pestilences” and “famine-pestilences” with
epidemics of typhus fever; those pestilences, appearing at
epochs of general misery, for the most part represent a mixture
of diseases, especially catarrh of the stomach, dysentery,
scurvy, typhus fever, and frequently malaria and typhoid
fever, which not only by chroniclers, but also by medical
statisticians, have quite often been lumped together as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span><em>one disease</em>.’ It is to-day almost impossible to analyse these
accounts, in which we can distinguish only individual
characteristics of those various diseases. This appears most
distinctly in the reports of the chroniclers and historians
regarding the war pestilences and famine pestilences of
antiquity, and it also explains the futile effort of the historians
to reduce to one disease known to us the numerous and complicated
symptoms which they have looked upon as the
expression of a single disease-process—an effort which has
led some of them to the somewhat extravagant conclusion,
that they were diseases which are now extinct. The same
backwardness, furthermore, characterizes—though to a lesser
extent—the descriptions which the physicians of the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries wrote of the epidemics of
‘putrid fever’, ‘bilious fever’, and ‘mucous fever’ occurring
at that time. Here, too, in many cases it was evidently
a question of the simultaneous outbreak of various diseases,
the nature of which even the most expert critic could not
afterwards determine with certainty.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the end of the fifteenth century typhus fever was
prevalent in many parts of Europe; the first scientific
account of it comes from the pen of Fracastorius, who had
an opportunity to observe the disease during the epidemics
in Italy in 1505–8, and who described it as a disease indigenous
to Cyprus and the neighbouring islands and appearing
for the first time in Italy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The names given to the disease were numerous and cannot
all be mentioned here; the name ‘Hauptweh’ (headache)
or ‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hauptkrankheit</span>’ (head-disease) was current in Germany,
while the additional words ‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">ohne Sterbedrüsen</span>’ (without
death glands) expressly distinguish the disease from bubonic
plague. T. von Györy<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c011'><sup>[20]</sup></a> mentions a large number of synonyms—Hungarian
disease, lazaret fever, spotted fever, petechial
disease, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1490 the disease was borne by Spanish soldiers, who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>fought in the Venetian army against Turkey, from Cyprus
to Spain, and during the war of Ferdinand the Catholic
against the Moors it spread to Granada and did more damage
to the Spanish army than the swords of the Moors.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c011'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In the year 1490 a serious epidemic broke out in Lorraine,
which Maréchal and Didion<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c011'><sup>[22]</sup></a> think was typhus fever; it
appeared in that bitter and indescribably cruel conflict
between René, Duke of Lorraine, and the people of Metz.
Despite the armistice proclaimed on June 18, the pestilence
spread far and wide and in August entered Metz, compelling
the inhabitants to take to flight; the nobles retired to their
castles, and the citizens went out into the country. And
although the city was strictly quarantined, the disease
spread throughout Lorraine and northern Alsace.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the year 1528 an epidemic of typhus fever occurred in
connexion with warlike events. This pestilence broke out
in Upper Italy and spread to Lower Italy, where a war was
going on between French troops on the one side and German
and Spanish troops on the other. The loss of human life
was uncommonly large, 30,000 French soldiers and twice as
many non-belligerent inhabitants are said to have died.
And the pestilence was also borne from Italy to Germany.</p>

<p class='c007'>Well known in history is the great pestilence which in
1552 forced Emperor Charles V to raise the siege of Metz,
which had been going on for two months (November and
December). Maréchal gives us detailed information about
this;<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c011'><sup>[23]</sup></a> the Emperor’s army, he says, which consisted of
80,000 German, Spanish, and Italian troops, in addition
to the enormous camp-following that always accompanied
armies at that time, was reduced one-third by the end of
December through desertion, disease, and disablement.
According to the report of the Venetian physician, Andreas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Gratiolo, the widespread diseases were typhus fever and
dysentery. The appearance of these diseases was favoured
by the congregating of such enormous numbers of people in
tents and inadequate places of shelter, and also by the great
dampness and the lack of the necessaries of life. The extreme
cold, which prevented the dispersion and isolation of the
patients, also favoured the dissemination of the disease.
More than 200 men died in the barracks every day, while
10,000 men, all told, are said to have succumbed. It was
also observed that the Spaniards and Italians suffered more
than the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Landsknechte</span></i> and other German troops, since they
could not stand the severity of the climate so well. During
the siege, hospital-fever and scurvy raged in the city itself,
and after the siege was raised, in the night of January 1, 1553,
typhus fever broke out there, having been borne into the
hospitals by wounded soldiers from the enemy’s camp, or
else brought back by citizens who had been out to inspect
the position of the besiegers. During the siege the surrounding
country had been most terribly ravaged by the enemy’s
soldiers, so that the inhabitants were in the greatest misery,
without food and without any source of help. For the spread
of typhus fever this afforded a very favourable soil, and it
raged furiously in the months of June and July in the villages
surrounding Metz.</p>

<p class='c007'>The battles with the Turks in the east did a great deal
toward spreading typhus fever throughout Europe; for
that reason the name ‘Hungarian disease’ came into existence.
Toward the end of the fifteenth century, hitherto
prosperous Hungary, by endless wars with Turkey and by
international strife, was brought to the very verge of ruin.
Agriculture ceased almost entirely, the development of the
country came to a standstill, large tracts of land, such as
the Banat region, assumed the appearance of a vast swamp,
while at the same time the alternate cold nights and hot
days, together with the great dampness, were very unhealthy
for the foreign soldiers, who were not accustomed to such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>a climate. Partly this, and partly the utter lack of sanitation,
increased the baneful effects of camp-life. Dirt and refuse
accumulated in heaps, vermin multiplied so rapidly that it
was impossible to get rid of them, corpses were inadequately
buried, while enormous numbers of flies and gnats molested
the soldiers and did a great deal toward spreading infectious
diseases. The hospitals were in a pitiable condition, and
since the soldiers, after their previous experiences, had little
hope of leaving the country alive, they gave themselves
over to a most dissolute life, in consequence of which the
country suffered terribly. Several contemporaries bear
witness to the fact that a large part of the German troops
never once faced the enemy, for the reason that they succumbed
beforehand to ‘Hungarian disease’, which killed
more of them than the swords of the Turks. Hence Hungary
was called at that time the ‘Cemetery of the Germans’.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Hungarian disease’ was typhus fever, which manifested
certain unusual characteristics for the reason that the German
troops, being unaccustomed to the local foods, inclined
considerably toward intestinal catarrh and scurvy, while
many of them also suffered from malaria, which weakened
their power of resistance. The sudden beginning with a chill,
the appearance of lenticular spots on the fourth, fifth, or
sixth day, the duration of about fourteen days, the sudden
fall of temperature—all these symptoms, mentioned by
witnesses, definitely stamp the disease as typhus fever. If
the disease has been identified by many historians with
bubonic plague, the reason is that in serious cases of typhus
fever suppuration of the salivary glands, gangrene of the
lower extremities, of the nose and ears, &amp;c., are not infrequent
occurrences.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to Györy,<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c011'><sup>[24]</sup></a> the pestilence which raged so
furiously in the army of Joachim, Margrave of Brandenburg,
when the latter was in Hungary in 1542, was typhus fever.
He assumes that the disease was borne thither by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Italian troops which the Pope had sent to help fight against
the Turks, although he cannot base his assumption on any
argument save that typhus fever was no rare disease in Italy.
It is much more probable, however, that the disease was
already endemic in Hungary at that time, whether from of
yore, or whether the Turks had brought it there. So much,
however, is certain, that the Germans suffered a great deal
more from it than did the Hungarians and Turks, who had
probably already survived attacks of the disease and had
thus become immune.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Hungarian disease’ acquired greater importance in the
year 1566, when it spread from Hungary over a large part
of Europe. It was then that this name first came into
fashion. According to Thomas Jordanus, who took part
in the expedition, the disease broke out on the island of
Komorn during the war of Maximilian II against the Turks;
from there it spread further west and forced the Emperor
to conclude a treaty of peace which favoured the Turks.
After the dispersion of the army the discharged soldiers
carried the disease in all directions.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c011'><sup>[25]</sup></a> Vienna was hit very
hard; not only separate houses, but also entire streets,
were filled with victims of the disease. The returning
Italians brought the disease first to Carinthia, where it
broke out severely in Villach, and then to Italy. In the
year 1567 the pestilence carried away 400 people in the little
town of Villach, and from there it spread to Styria. In the
same way it was carried to Bohemia, Germany, Burgundy,
Belgium, and Spain.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the end of the sixteenth century typhus fever appeared
in Hungary with renewed virulence; during the siege of
Papa it raged with particular severity among the Italian
troops, and according to Coberus all the patients in the field-hospital
died.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III<br /> <span class='large'>THE THIRTY YEARS’ WAR</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>At the beginning of the seventeenth century, epidemics of
bubonic plague and typhus fever were frequent occurrences
in various parts of Central Europe, but they were usually
kept localized by the strict measures that were adopted, in
accordance with the best scientific knowledge of the time,
to prevent them from spreading; the houses in which the
patients lay were quarantined, strangers from infected places
were forbidden to enter the cities under penalty of death,
the clothes and beds used by the patients were burned, while
in the streets and public squares fumigations took place.
But in the storm and stress of the Thirty Years’ War such
precautions could be taken only to a limited extent, and
even when they were energetically carried out, they did no
good, since diseases were so frequently borne from place to
place. A further consequence of the long war was famine,
which was caused by the devastation of the fields and the
non-cultivation of the land, due to the lack of workers.
This made it easier for pestilences to become unusually widespread
throughout Germany. The fact that the scene of
the war kept changing was also to a great extent responsible
for the gradual dissemination of various diseases, since the
regions in which the fighting was going on were always particularly
exposed to pestilential devastation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unfortunately we possess, for the various pestilences,
scarcely any accounts written by physicians, and with a
few exceptions must rely upon the information given by
chroniclers. In most cases, therefore, it is impossible to
state with certainty just what the individual diseases were.
Consequently, inasmuch as the word ‘plague’ is used in
the chronicles for any serious pestilence, we have adopted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>it in this same general sense in our account, without necessarily
meaning thereby bubonic plague. Certainly one of
the most common ‘war diseases’ at that time was typhus
fever, and diseases that were commonly called ‘burning,
virulent fever’, ‘plague’, ‘head-disease’, ‘Hungarian
disease’, and ‘Swedish disease’, were undoubtedly nothing
else but that. At the same time real plague, bubonic
plague, now and then occurred, and the word ‘plague’ is
thus very often used in its proper sense, especially in reference
to the pestilences of the years 1630–6. ‘In the history of
this calamitous war,’ says Seitz,<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c011'><sup>[26]</sup></a> ‘we see typhus fever like
a malignant spectre hovering over the armies wherever they
go, in their camps, on their marches, and in their permanent
quarters, and preparing an inglorious end for thousands of
valiant warriors. Its ravages among the non-belligerent
population in town and country caused the inhabitants of
many provinces to remember with hatred and loathing the
departed soldiers, who were usually accused of having
planted the seed of death.’</p>

<p class='c007'>In general one may say that before 1630 the specific
disease was usually typhus fever, and that after 1630 bubonic
plague spread along with this disease throughout Germany;
the death statistics of the larger cities, adduced at the end
of this chapter, lead us to this conclusion. In addition to
these two diseases, we find frequent mention of dysentery,
scurvy, and, toward the end of the war, small-pox.</p>

<p class='c007'>Innumerable articles, chronicles, &amp;c., have described in detail
the miserable condition of the German countries during
the Thirty Years’ War. The following account is largely
based upon a notable work by a physician named Lammert,
who offers us a chronological enumeration of the pestilences
of that time, and also an exhaustive bibliography.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c011'><sup>[27]</sup></a> Since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>it is impossible to discuss here thoroughly all the countless
epidemics that occurred, we can merely point out their
main features and indicate their connexion with warlike
events. The figures quoted may be relied upon, if, as is
usually the case, they are taken from church-registers; as
regards statements taken from chronicles, on the other hand,
there is more occasion for distrust. For a correct understanding
of the facts, to be sure, we should have to know
the exact population of the cities and towns, and this information
is only in rare instances available. We must bear
in mind, furthermore, that the country-people fled to the
cities when armies were approaching, and also that nearly
all cities were surrounded by walls and embankments.</p>

<p class='c007'>The war began in Bohemia. After the battle on White
Hill, near Prague (November 8, 1620), the soldiers of Count
Mansfeld, who were already infected with typhus fever,
marched down the Main to the Palatinate and to Alsace,
devastating the country as they passed and leaving severe
pestilences behind them. In the year 1625 the main scene
of the war was transferred to the north, where numerous
epidemics had already broken out in the course of that year.
The disorder caused by the war, and especially the wild
warfare of Wallenstein, who in the fall of 1625, after mustering
his army, had joined forces with Tilly, were particularly
favourable to the spreading of disease. Hence in the years
1625–6 we see precisely in North Germany the ‘plague’
doing the greatest damage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The battle of Barenberg (near Lutter, August 1626) gave
the Imperialists the upper hand in North Germany. This
ascendancy was taken away from them, however, with the
appearance of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, who won a
complete victory over Tilly in the battle of Breitenfeld
(September 17, 1631). After that, Gustavus Adolphus
advanced to the Lower Main (Frankfurt and Mayence), and
the following year carried the war into Bavaria, which now
became the principal scene of the fighting. After the battle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>of Nördlingen (September 7, 1634), the fugitive Swedish
Protestant army, pursued by the Imperialists, retreated
through Württemberg, Baden, and Hesse to the Rhine,
where the war was now carried on for several years. Both
armies were badly infected with disease, and spread pestilence
wherever they went. After the battle of Nördlingen
the war became decentralized, splitting up into a number
of warlike movements throughout all Germany; and everywhere
these movements occurred they added, if possible,
to the misery of the people.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the year 1631 that terrible epoch of plague began
which reached its climax in the years 1634–5 and lasted well
into the following year. Its widespread character was due
to the innumerable plundering and devastating marches of
the Protestant-Swedish and Imperialist-Catholic armies back
and forth across the country, and also to the consequent
famine. Everything the brutalized soldiers could not consume
themselves or take with them, they destroyed or burned.
There was an absolute dearth of farm-workers, and in
addition to that, the year 1635 was dry and unproductive.
Horrible are the descriptions of the hunger and misery which
the people in all parts of Germany experienced at that time.
Under such conditions pestilences could spread unhindered;
to be sure, they relaxed a little after the year 1638, but by
no means ceased entirely. Whenever real plague disappeared,
typhus fever, which was prevalent in all parts of
the army took its place; and thus diseases were borne from
place to place until the very end of that disastrous war.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>I. The War in Bohemia and the Palatinate (1618–24)</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>The year 1620 saw the first warlike events of any importance;
at the beginning they were confined to Bohemia,
where in November 1619, Frederick, Elector of the Palatinate,
had been crowned King of Bohemia. In the first
part of the year 1620 typhus fever broke out in Austria
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>and Bohemia among the poorly nourished troops of the
Catholic League, carrying away, it is said, 20,000 Bavarian
soldiers. After the League’s successful battle on White
Hill (November 8, 1620), the disease was borne by Bavarian
soldiers back to Upper Bavaria and Württemberg; it is
stated that it caused an eruption of red spots over the entire
body, and that headache, dizziness, and stupefaction were
prevailing symptoms.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c011'><sup>[28]</sup></a> Munich, by adopting strict measures
of precaution—isolation of the patients in houses outside
of the city, disinfection of suspected effects and incoming
letters, washing in vinegar of money sent in from infected
localities—managed to exclude the disease from the city
limits. In 1620 the troops of Count Mansfeld conveyed
the disease, which was called ‘head-disease’, to Franconia,
where in the following year it raged extensively. In consequence
of their marauding expeditions, typhus fever also
became very widespread in the Upper Palatinate—Neumarkt
and Weiden are mentioned as places where it appeared;
in Weiden 250 persons died, three or four times as many as
in normal years. Count Mansfeld then marched down the
Main and along the Neckar to Mannheim, and everywhere
his soldiers went they left behind them the germ of typhus
fever: e.g. in Boxberg (near Mergentheim), in Neckarelz
(near Mosbach), in Eberbach, in Ladenburg and Viernheim
(both near Mannheim), and in many other places.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the following year Lorraine, the Palatinate, and northern
Baden became the scenes of Count Mansfeld’s predatory
incursions. Since the country-people fled to the cities, the
latter became greatly overcrowded; in Strassburg, for
example, whither 23,000 country-people had sought refuge,
a severe pestilence (chiefly dysentery) broke out and carried
away in the course of that year (1622) 4,388 people. ‘Headdisease’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>broke out in Wimpfen-on-the-Neckar, after the
battle fought there on May 6, in consequence of the arrival
of over 900 hundred sick and wounded soldiers; the result
was that a large proportion of the inhabitants were taken
sick, and a third of them died. In the Palatinate, through
which Mansfeld passed on one of his predatory raids, the
mortality in town and country, in consequence of dysentery
and other diseases, was very great. Again, in Frankfurt-on-the-Main
typhus fever broke out in 1622, and 1,785 people
died (as compared with 600–700 in normal years). In
Mayence and vicinity the disease became very widespread
in the year 1624. A plague also broke out in Nuremberg
in October 1624, carrying away 2,487 people that year,
and 2,881 the following year.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Palatinate suffered terribly in the year 1623 from the
continued marauding of Mansfeld’s army, and in consequence
of cross-marches of Spanish and Walloon troops
pestilential diseases were conveyed from there to Lorraine.
In July 1623, according to Maréchal and Didion,<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c011'><sup>[29]</sup></a> typhus
fever or bubonic plague broke out in the village of Lessy
and raged furiously for two months. Despite energetic
measures that were taken to prevent the disease from
spreading, neighbouring and even more or less remote
villages were infected, so that in 1624 the entire country
was suffering. In spite of the fact that all strangers were
forbidden to enter the city of Metz under penalty of death,
the disease made its appearance there in May 1625, and in
less than ten months carried away 3,000 people. Of the
cities surrounding Metz, all of which were infected, Verdun
had a particularly high mortality. The epidemic spread
from the Palatinate to Württemberg, Baden, Hanau, Nassau,
and down the Rhine; for the most part it was typhus fever.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the year 1623 the army of the Catholic League spread
infectious diseases throughout Hesse, particularly in the
region of the Werra. When the army withdrew, it left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>dysentery behind it, for example, in Witzenhausen, Eschwege,
and Hersfeld; in July and August it carried away
many victims. A pestilential disease broke out on June 3,
1624, in Hersfeld, carrying away from October 4, 1624, to
January 1625, 316 persons. In 1625, ‘hunger typhus’ and
bubonic plague appeared in Nassau; the pestilence began
in Dillenburg on December 18, 1625, and lasted until
October 30, 1626, carrying away in this time 378 people—about
one-third of the population. The climax of the
pestilence came in July. A plague also broke out among
the soldiers in Walsdorf-on-the Ems, likewise in Idstein,
remaining there for several years.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c012'>II. <span class='sc'>The War in Saxony, Thuringia, Brandenburg, and Pomerania (1625–30)</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>The years 1625 and 1626 were bad pest-years; according
to Lammert, the various epidemics that occurred were
partly typhus fever, partly bubonic plague, and partly
dysentery. The pestilences spread over Saxony, Thuringia,
Silesia, Eastern Prussia, Posen, Poland, and Moravia, and
carried away large numbers of people. They were not
always directly connected with warlike events, as shown
by the fact that many provinces that were spared by the
war were attacked by the diseases. On the other hand,
the incursion of Wallenstein’s troops into Saxony and
Thuringia caused pestilence to become unusually widespread.</p>

<p class='c007'>From 1625 to the time of the battle of Breitenfeld (1631)
Saxony suffered terribly from pestilences that were caused
and prolonged by the war, though by no means as terribly
as in the years 1631–3. Dresden and Leipzig, comparatively
speaking, were but slightly affected. Of 13,000 inhabitants
that Dresden had in the year 1626, 341 succumbed to a
plague which began in April and disappeared in December;
the disease was called ‘burning fever’, ‘spotted fever’,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>and ‘pestilential spotted fever’, while in the records of the
town council we find mention of ‘spots, often the size of
a groschen, all over the body’, and also of ‘swellings’.
Inasmuch as abscesses and gangrene are often observed in
cases of typhus fever, it seems likely that it was that disease.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c011'><sup>[30]</sup></a>
Of 14,500 inhabitants in Leipzig only 122 succumbed to it,
although houses in all the streets were infected. Here
again, accordingly, we see how slight the danger to life is
in the case of typhus fever.</p>

<p class='c007'>The western part of the present kingdom of Saxony
suffered considerably more than the eastern part. In the
year 1625 plagues broke out in the cities of Plauen, Reichenbach
(1,000 deaths), and Zwickau; the last-named city was
revisited in June 1626, and between then and the end of
the year 216 people died there. Pestilence also broke out
in the vicinity of Leipzig in 1626—in Borna (70 deaths), in
Grimma (350 deaths), and in Wurzen, where it appeared in
August. The following places nearer Dresden were also the
scenes of plagues that year: Rosswein (near Döbeln—376
deaths), Mitweida (outbreak on April 9, 1626—number of
deaths before that day 22, between that day and the end
of the year, 1,000), Frankenberg (581 deaths), Freiberg (752
deaths in the year 1626—500 of them due to the plague).
The village of Dohna, south of Dresden, is also mentioned;
in the year 1626 there were 157 deaths there, as compared
with an average annual mortality of 60. In the Erzgebirge
plagues appeared in various places in the year 1625; 134 people
died in Annaberg and 323 people in Zöblitz. In 1626 there
were 205 deaths in Schwarzenberg, 178 deaths in Gottesgabe,
and 81 deaths in Breitenbrunn. Two towns in eastern
Saxony, Bischofswerda and Zittau, are also mentioned;
there were 182 deaths in the former in the year 1625.</p>

<p class='c007'>All Thuringia suffered severely from pestilences in the
years 1625–6. In the year 1625 the number of deaths in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Eisenach had increased to 315, while in 1626 a plague raged
so murderously that 769 persons succumbed to it; other
reports say 2,500, but this number doubtless includes the
refugees. In the following year the number of deaths
decreased to 156. In Ruhla, a neighbouring village, 98 persons
succumbed to the plague. In many Thuringian cities
the epidemic had already secured a foothold in the year 1625,
and was then spread over a very large territory by Wallenstein’s
invasion. Schmalkalden was the scene of a plague
from June to August, 1625, and in Gotha one broke out at
the end of July, 1625, carrying away 722 persons that year
and 209 the following year. In Erfurt, which had some
15,000 inhabitants, 3,474 people are said to have succumbed
to a plague in the year 1626, the strict ordinances passed by
the town council on December 25, 1625, being of no avail.
The small communities and cities lying to the north of
Erfurt, according to the reports, were very severely attacked;
in the year 1625 Ballstädt, with a population of 600, lost
365, while in the year 1626 the number of deaths in Gräfentonna
was 510, in Gebesee 275, in Kindelbrück 1,514, in
Straussfurth 367, in Weissensee 500, and Cölleda 1,000. In
the region south of Erfurt the village of Ohrdruf lost 203
inhabitants in the year 1625, and 143 in the following year.
In Arnstadt 1,236 people succumbed in 1625 to ‘head-disease’
and bubonic plague—a number corresponding to
one-quarter of the population. Gräfenroda had 1,630 deaths
in the year 1625, and Tambach 400 deaths in 1626. Koburg
and Rudolstadt were also visited by a plague in 1626, while
towns in the vicinity of the latter, Königssee, Schwarza,
Tanna, and Schleiz, had 707, 129, 195, and 181 deaths respectively.
The neighbouring town of Pössnek in the year 1625
had already lost 1,000 inhabitants. Jena and Weimar both
suffered, while there were 228 deaths in Gera and 1,100
deaths in Zeitz due to pestilence. Many other places in
Thuringia that suffered from plagues are not mentioned
here.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>That part of Saxony which corresponds to the modern
province of Saxony fared in much the same way as Thuringia,
while those parts bordering directly on the kingdom
of Saxony were relatively less severely attacked. A plague
broke out in Eilenburg in September 1625, and carried away
many persons there and in the surrounding country. At
Delitsch (west of Eilenburg) a dangerous fever (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">febris maligna</span></i>—probably
typhus fever) spread through the wandering
armies, and before the beginning of autumn carried away
150 persons. In the winter the disease subsided a little, but
broke out again in June 1626, and carried away 880 people—in
September alone there were 229 deaths, and numerous
families were completely wiped out. A plague also raged
in the vicinity of Halle; not until the following year, however,
did it break out in the city itself, whither it was borne
by Imperialist soldiers, and where it caused, from June to
December, 3,400 deaths. In Eisleben (east of Halle) a
plague began in May 1626, and carried away 30 to 50 people
daily, so that the total number of deaths for the year was
3,068. Merseburg lost 341 inhabitants in the year 1626,
and a plague raged in Naumburg in the years 1625–6. The
town of Querfurt (west of Merseburg) in 1625 was for seven
weeks the quarters of 3,000 of Wallenstein’s soldiers; they
brought dysentery with them, and the result was that 200
citizens died. In the second half of the following year
a plague broke out and carried away 1,400 inhabitants of
the city (including 200 soldiers) and numerous inhabitants
of the surrounding country. The town and vicinity of
Sangershausen were also severely attacked; the pestilence
began in the town in June 1626, and reached its climax in
September with 570 deaths—1,323 deaths, all told, are recorded
in the church register for that year, but the figure is
said to be too small. Lammert mentions sixteen surrounding
villages in which a total of 2,960 deaths occurred in the year
1626. In Sondershausen 54 people died up to the end of
July of that year, 36 in August, 137 in September, and 143
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>in October; the mortality then decreased, but not until
466 persons had died, 400 of them in consequence of the
plague. In the near-by towns of Frankenhausen and Langensalza
the number of deaths was 915 and 913 respectively,
the latter town having been visited by a plague the year
before. Nordhausen, from January 1, 1626, to December 6,
1626, lost 3,283 inhabitants—2,504 natives and 779 refugees
from other places. In Stolberg (north-east of Nordhausen)
a plague broke out on June 27, 1626, and caused 623 deaths.
Quedlinburg, Aschersleben, and Halberstadt were also
attacked; in Aschersleben a plague broke out on June 15,
1625, and between then and the end of the year carried
away 157 persons. The total number of deaths in the year
1625 was 534, in the following year 1,800 (1,066 in consequence
of the plague), not including the soldiers; the years
1627–9 had a remarkably low mortality. In 1626 a plague
carried away 549 persons in Gröningen (near Halberstadt).
The cities on the Elbe and the surrounding country were
severely attacked; a pestilence broke out in Dessau on
September 3, 1625, and between then and the end of the
year 224 persons were buried—399 in the entire year. The
disease reappeared in the summer of the following year,
having caused 662 deaths, while only 39 died in the year
following. In Aiken-on-the-Elbe (below Dessau) 1,000 persons,
including soldiers, succumbed to a plague in the year
1626. In the cities on the Saale, above its confluence with
the Elbe, a plague raged furiously; in Bernburg it appeared
in the second half of the year 1625, carrying away 1,340
persons in that year (the number of deaths in the following
year being 425); Kalbe was also severely attacked. A
plague broke out in Magdeburg at the end of June 1625,
and lasted well into the next year; the wealthy citizens
fled from the city, but were compelled to return by the
approach of the Imperialists, and the result was that several
thousand inhabitants died. The country to the south-west
of Magdeburg, as far as Bode, suffered severely—Osterweddingen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Wanzleben, Gross-Salze, Förderstedt, Egeln, Wolmirsleben,
and other places. Several soldiers quartered in
Förderstedt had succumbed to a plague in June and July
1626, and had infected the citizens with the disease, which
carried away 155 of them. A plague broke out in Egeln
in October 1625, and reached its climax in February 1626;
from January until August 16 of that year 296 persons died
there. In Unseberg, which had been infected in August
1625, some 400 citizens and soldiers were buried in the year
1626, in addition to many who were secretly buried in
gardens, thickets, and fields. The plague raged with particular
fury in August 1626; in Volmirstadt 246 persons
died between July 6 and October 1626—144 in September
alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Lower Saxony, in the region between the Elbe and the
Weser, most of which to-day belongs to Hanover, a plague
raged virulently in the years 1625–7. In Osterode, whither
numerous country people had fled from the approaching
war, a very severe pestilence broke out; in the Saint
Aegidius community alone 1,500 persons died, among them
many outsiders. In Klausthal 1,350, in Andreasberg 700,
in Einbeck 3,000, and in Hameln 1,143 people succumbed
to bubonic plague and ‘head disease’. In Goslar, where
the pestilence had appeared in 1625, conditions were rendered
particularly bad by the fact that many wounded Imperialists
were brought there after the battle of Barenberg (near Lutter—August
27, 1626); most of these soldiers died there, 3,000
deaths due to pestilence having occurred in Goslar in the
years 1625–6. Wallenstein’s soldiers also brought pestilence
with them to Helmstedt (in the region of Brunswick);
here one-third of the citizens died, and 295 houses were
rendered tenantless. The university faculty fled several
times to Brunswick, the students either going home or
enlisting in the army. This plague did not come to an end
for two years. The surrounding villages, furthermore, were
severely attacked by it; during the siege of Göttingen by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Tilly (June to August 12, 1626) it became very widespread,
since the city was overcrowded with fugitives. From 50
to 60 persons were buried every day. In near-by Dransfeld
700 people died, in Wolfenbüttel 1,705. In Hanover,
where a plague had already broken out in the year 1625,
a reappearance of it in March 1626 drove out the garrison.
The severity of this plague, which carried away 3,000 people,
was increased by the numerous fugitives in the city; about
one-third of the population survived. In the city of Nienburg,
which was besieged by the Imperialists after the battle
of Barenberg, a pestilence likewise broke out among the
inhabitants and in the garrison. In Lüneburg it lasted
from 1625 to 1628, and in Osnabrück from August 1625 to
the end of the year.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the years 1625–6 Wallenstein’s soldiers carried pestilence
into the region north of Magdeburg; in Neuhaldensleben
76 persons were carried away between the end of
August and the first of the year, not including those who
were buried secretly. The following year it demanded a
considerably larger number of victims—583; the maximum
was in June—147. In the Altmark (north-eastern part of
the province of Saxony) dysentery, bubonic plague, and
typhus fever broke out almost everywhere during the years
1625–8. Dysentery appeared in the Danish garrison at
Tangermünde and carried away 1,600 people, and on June 29,
1626, the Danes withdrew from the place. Stendal was
also visited by a plague after the departure of the Danes;
it broke out in July, and in a few months caused 2,511 deaths,
the normal mortality being 280–290. Numerous bodies were
secretly buried, while many peasants who had fled to the
city were among the dead; thus the total number of deaths
was estimated at 5,000. In Osterburg 624 people died in
the years 1626–8, and in Bismark 163 persons died in the
year 1626. In the city of Havelberg 668 persons succumbed
to dysentery, ‘head-disease’, and bubonic plague, the latter
alone carrying away about 400. A pestilence was conveyed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>to Gardenlegen by the soldiers of Count George of Brunswick,
who had his head-quarters there; the number of deaths
there in the year 1626 amounted to no less than 1,514. In
Salzwedel 335 persons died in the year 1625, and 451 in the
following year, the plague being responsible for 400 of the
latter. In Seehausen dysentery first appeared, and soon
gave way to ‘war-plague’ (typhus fever), which lasted until
1628; some 200 of the soldiers quartered there died, and as
many as 1,100 inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c007'>Brandenburg also suffered, particularly in the south-eastern
part, when Wallenstein’s army, in pursuit of Count
Mansfeld, turned into Silesia; there were 386 deaths in
Luckau, 900 in Kottbus, 500 in Forst, 112 in Spremberg,
and 902 in Jüterbog.</p>

<p class='c007'>Further north, plagues were considerably less widespread
in the years 1625–6. In 1625 typhus fever broke out severely
in Lübeck and the surrounding country, carrying away 6,952
people, while in Bremen, which had had cases of plague in
1625, a widespread outbreak in 1627 carried away some
10,000 people, natives and refugees. Mecklenburg, being
further away from the scene of the war, suffered somewhat
less. In the year 1625 bubonic plague, ‘head-disease’, and
dysentery appeared in Rostock, Wismar, Schwerin, Plau,
and New Brandenburg. In the following year a plague
broke out in Parchim, reached its climax in May, and lasted
until November, carrying away 1,600 persons. In Flensburg
a plague broke out during the occupation of the
Imperialists (1627) and lasted until their departure (1630).</p>

<p class='c007'>The pestilences of the year 1627 were not very widespread,
and this applies also to the territory in Saxony and Thuringia
which had suffered so severely in the years 1625–6.
On the other hand, the countries in the northern part of
Germany, particularly Pomerania and Schleswig-Holstein,
were severely attacked in those years, owing to the fact that
Wallenstein had transferred thither the scene of the war.
In the year 1628 Hamburg had taken in a great many foreign
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>fugitives, and the result was that typhus fever soon broke
out in the city and carried away many thousands of people.
The war brought great misery into North Friesland and the
Frisian Islands; the Imperialists and Danes oppressed the
people by enforced quartering and extortions of all kinds,
and the result was famine and plague, lasting until 1630.
In Stade, which Tilly in 1629 had made his head-quarters,
both the inhabitants and the garrison suffered terribly from
a severe epidemic of dysentery. In the city of Schleswig
a plague broke out in September, and again in November,
in consequence of the quartering of Imperialist troops; it
devastated the entire city, so that 211 houses stood absolutely
empty on Christmas Day, 1628. Mecklenburg was
revisited in 1629, and on August 13 of that year a plague
broke out in Rostock and Teterow. Imperialist soldiers
conveyed pestilence to the city of Plau, where they passed
the night of November 29; but in 1630 it appeared in a
much more severe form there and carried away 600 people.
In the year 1630 a plague broke out in Mecklenburg, and in
Gustrow one raged from May 7 to the beginning of September.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the years 1628–9 Pomerania was ravaged by the
Imperialists, with resulting pestilence and famine. Greifswald
suffered for four years from a pestilence which reached
its climax in the year 1631. Grimmen, Stargard (3,500
deaths in the years 1627–30), Freienwalde, and other places
were also attacked. In Greifenberg, where soldiers had been
quartered in large numbers, it raged with unusual fury;
three-fourths of the city were devastated, and when the
Swedes arrived only 42 houses were uninfected. Kolberg
(on the Persante) in six months lost 3,000 inhabitants in
consequence of a pestilence. On account of the oppression
caused by the war, many citizens fled from Koslin, which,
despite the decrease in population, lost 919 inhabitants in the
year 1630. In Stolp 800 people died in consequence of a plague.</p>

<p class='c007'>A plague was borne into Silesia in July 1623, and in
Bunzlau an average of thirty persons per week died; of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>760 deaths in the year, 640 were due to the pestilence.
Many adults fled to near-by villages and died there. In
the following year a plague broke out again in Bunzlau, but
as only 130 people died there in 1625, it seemed as though
the pestilence was over. In September and October, 1626,
however, it broke out again, and of 228 deaths that occurred
that year, 149 were directly attributable to the plague. In
July 1624 it appeared in Friedeberg and carried away 51
persons. In Löwenberg it began in September 1624; the
citizens fled from the city and set up tents in the fields, but
in spite of this, from forty to fifty people died every day,
and the total number of deaths for the year was some 3,000.
In the year 1625 the pestilence was very widespread in
Silesia—Hirschberg, Löwenberg, Herzogswaldau, Liegnitz,
Neumarkt, Waldenburg, Neisse, and other places were
attacked. In Breslau ‘head-disease’ raged from June to
the end of that year, carrying away 3,000 people; 1626 was
also a year of pestilence for Breslau. In Neustadt (Governmental
District of Oppeln) a pestilence raged with particular
fury from May till September 1625; for the years 1624 to
1627 the deaths were respectively 198, 420, 175, and 472.
On August 21, 1626, an army of 6,000 Imperialists under
Count von Merode encamped at Goldberg; most of them
were infected with disease; and after their departure a
plague broke out with such severity that a large part of the
population died.</p>

<p class='c007'>During this time, from 1625 to 1630, when epidemics were
raging almost everywhere in North Germany, South Germany
also suffered, since diseases were often brought there by
Imperialist troops and wandering rabble. In the year 1626
Württemberg alone lost 28,000 people in consequence of
plagues.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c011'><sup>[31]</sup></a> A pestilence in Augsburg (1628) became very
widespread and caused 9,000 deaths. In the year 1629
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>‘head-disease’ broke out in Württemberg and Alsace.
During the isolation of the city of Hanau (from December 6,
1629, to March 12, 1630) by the Imperialist commander
Witzleben, a pestilential disease, which the soldiers had
brought with them, broke out and caused many deaths
throughout the entire vicinity.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>III. <span class='sc'>The War Years 1630–40</span></h3>

<h4 class='c014'>1. <em>North Germany until the Peace of Prague</em></h4>

<p class='c013'>In the year 1630 began in Saxony—in the wake of marching
troops—that deadly pestilence which soon spread over
all Germany and was chiefly responsible for the enormous
loss of human life there in the course of the Thirty Years’
War. We may safely assume that bubonic plague was the
most common disease, although both typhus fever and
dysentery were of frequent occurrence. In the years 1630–1
the pestilence was confined for the most part to North
Germany; the Electorate of Saxony suffered the worst,
934,000 people, according to the reports, having died there
in consequence of the war and of diseases.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c011'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The pestilence broke out in Leipzig in October 1630, and
carried away 301 persons; it was borne there presumably
by two foreign orange-pedlars. In October of the following
year it broke out again, when the Imperialists, after besieging
the city for several weeks, on September 13 had finally
captured it. The number of deaths in the entire year was
1,754. In the year 1632 Leipzig was once more the scene
of grave warlike events, and was compelled to live through
a second siege by Wallenstein; the plague began in June,
became very widespread in August, and from then till
October caused a great many deaths, the total number for
the year amounting to 1,390. In August 1633, Leipzig
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>was again besieged, and this likewise caused the outbreak
of a plague which lasted until December and carried away
761 persons; in 1634 it was apparently over, for of 306
deaths that are recorded for that year, only 24 were attributable
to the plague. In the years 1636–7, however, it
reappeared with great severity throughout the entire city.
The country surrounding Leipzig suffered a great deal in
the year 1633, which was the worst plague-year that Saxony
passed through. In the year 1632 Altenburg was occupied
by the Swedes, who were infected with some pestilential
disease, the germ of which they left behind them when they
withdrew on January 13, 1633. The disease spread rapidly,
acquired a virulent character, and carried away 2,104 persons,
among them many foreign refugees. Grimma and
Borna were severely attacked in 1633, while Wurzen suffered
less severely.</p>

<p class='c007'>The country north-east of Leipzig suffered severely from
plagues in 1631. After the battle of Breitenfeld (September
15, 1631) most of the wounded were brought to Eilenburg,
where in a few weeks a plague broke out and spread so
rapidly that 300 people died in the month of October alone.
After an abatement during the winter, it recommenced in
1632; the number of deaths for that year was 670, although
only 492 of them were due to the plague, while the disease
did not entirely disappear until 1636. The city of Belgern,
after it was plundered by Holk’s troops on October 1, 1632,
was visited by a plague; also Dommitsch, Oschatz (where
563 deaths occurred in 1631, and many more in 1633–4),
and Ortrand (where there were 800 deaths in the years 1631–3).
Plagues raged very frequently in Leisnig, Colditz, and Mittweida,
and in the villages and towns surrounding them.
In February 1631, Palatinate, Imperialist, and League troops
quartered in Leisnig, and the result was that ‘head-disease’
and bubonic plague became very widespread; in the following
year they reappeared, causing 443 deaths, while many
thousands are said to have died in the country districts.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>The same was true of the year 1633. A pestilence broke
out in Colditz in the year 1631, and in the following year
‘soldier’s disease’ (typhus fever) was brought there by
Swedish troops, while in 1633 bubonic plague caused 567
deaths. Mittweida suffered from plague in the years 1631–4,
243 persons dying there in the year 1634. In the year 1630
a very severe plague broke out in Freiberg; 1,147 people
died in the course of the year, 1,000 of them in consequence
of the disease. In the following year there were 124 more
deaths. In the autumn of 1632 pestilence raged so furiously
that several thousand people died in a short time—about
one-third of the population. Most of the bodies were buried
secretly, only about 3,000 regular funerals taking place. In
the year 1633 there were 1,632 interments, not including
those buried in secret. The plague affected the entire
vicinity of Freiberg and spared scarcely a single village;
many places were left empty and deserted.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Chemnitz 1,234 interments for the year 1632 are recorded
in the church register, and in the following year the plague
raged even more furiously: almost every house was attacked,
and the number of deaths amounted to 2,500. In Glauchau
and vicinity, as in all Saxony, 1633 was the worst year;
964 people died there in that year. The plague raged most
furiously from August to November, and lasted until 1634;
many bodies were found in the open fields. In the neighbouring
Waldenburg 392 people died in a few weeks in 1633,
in Lichtenstein 370, in Thurm 400. In Marienberg, a village
lying at the foot of the mountains, 1,000 people succumbed
in the year 1633 to typhus fever; the plague spread
into the Erzgebirge and caused 2,300 deaths in Schneeberg
and 157 deaths in the adjacent Neustädtle. A plague had
already broken out in Zwickau in 1632, and in the first part
of 1633 it became so severe that 1,500 people died in two
months in the summer of that year. The city was full of
sick people and dead bodies, and the number of reported
deaths for the year 1633 was 1,897; but the total number
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>of deaths, excluding the soldiers, is said to have been no less
than 6,000. Entire streets were devastated. Many of the
inhabitants fled to near-by villages, and thus spread the
infection. Crimmitschau was visited by a plague in 1630
(601 deaths), and again in 1633 (409 deaths); 92 families in
the last-named year were completely wiped out. Many
neighbouring places were also attacked; there were 700
deaths in Werdau, 300 in Steinpleiss, 150 in Königswalde, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>The invasion of Holk caused Vogtland to suffer terribly
in August of the year 1632, while his second invasion in the
summer of 1633 resulted in an even worse outbreak of disease.
In Reichenbach and vicinity, typhus fever, bubonic plague,
and dysentery prevailed in the year 1633; at first it was
called  ‘soldier’s disease’, and later  ‘bright plague’  (<i><span lang="no" xml:lang="no">helle
Pest</span></i>). Of 904 deaths that occurred that year, 785 were due
to the plague. In Plauen the number of deaths in 1633
was 1,748, in Oelsnitz 325 (217 due to the plague). Holk
himself succumbed to the plague in Adorf on August 30,
1633, while 1,000 of his troops also died.</p>

<p class='c007'>The eastern part of Saxony was also attacked. In Dresden
a plague broke out in 1632 and carried away numerous people;
it continued to rage in the following year, since the war prevented
the adoption of the usual measures of precaution. In
the year 1632 the number of Protestants buried by the church
was 3,129, and in the following year it was 4,585. Numerous
families were wiped out, and many houses were rendered
tenantless. In the year 1634 one half of the inhabitants fell
victims to the pestilence, while a large part of the city was
devastated in 1635. Since the reports of E. J. J. Meyer and of
the town council continually speak of  ‘swellings’, the disease
was no doubt bubonic plague.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c011'><sup>[33]</sup></a> In Dippoldiswalde (south-west
of Dresden) it raged so furiously in the years 1631–3
that entire families were wiped out; in those years there
were 189, 510, and 250 deaths respectively. Pirna is said
to have lost 4,000 inhabitants in consequence of the plague
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>in the years 1632–4, while Dittersdorf (south of Pirna) lost
405 inhabitants in the year 1632. The pestilence was borne
by Saxon troops to Sebnitz (south-east of Dresden). In
Stolpen it raged from 1632 to 1634. In October 1631 the
Croats brought pestilence to Bischofswerda, and more than
200 persons died in consequence of it. In March 1632 another
pestilence broke out there, carrying away 660 persons, so
that more than one-third of the houses stood empty. In
the year 1631 there were 1,000 deaths in Camenz. In Bautzen
there was a garrison of 500 men, almost all of whom died
in the year 1631; including the residents that were carried
away by the pestilence, the number of deaths there for that
year was about 1,000. Nor did the pestilence disappear
from Bautzen the following year.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lusatia was also the scene of pestilence; only a few places
were spared, and in Upper Lusatia 40,000 persons are said to
have been carried away by pestilences in the years 1631–3.
In the last part of September 1631, dysentery and bubonic
plague broke out in Görlitz, which had a Saxon garrison,
and carried away some 400 persons (excluding the soldiers)
between then and the end of the year. In June 1632 there
was a second outbreak of plague; it reached its climax in
October, and carried away 6,105 people (including 106
soldiers) in the course of the entire year. In the following
year 726 inhabitants and 435 soldiers succumbed to the
disease. Zittau suffered severely; as early as 1633 several
hundred soldiers and inhabitants succumbed to typhus fever,
while in the year 1632 ‘burning fever’, dysentery, and
bubonic plague appeared and carried away 1,246 persons
(according to other reports, 1,642 persons). Petechial fever
and bubonic plague, after a period of inactivity in the winter,
recommenced in the first part of 1633; the latter disease
reached its climax in September, carrying away 1,860 inhabitants
in that year, in addition to many Imperialist soldiers.
From October to December, 1634, Saxon and Brandenburg
soldiers, after their return from Bohemia, encamped near
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>Zittau, where various diseases soon broke out; the result was
that hundreds died, and the entire region became infected.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Province of Brandenburg was severely attacked by
a plague in the year 1631, but in the next year suffered
considerably less owing to the fact that the scene of the war
was transferred to other parts of Germany. In Berlin 777
people succumbed to a plague in the year 1630, while in the
following year it reappeared in a much severer form and
carried away 2,066 persons. In Spandau, after the capture
of the city by the Swedes on May 6, 1631, famine and
pestilence broke out and caused 1,500 deaths. A plague in
Potsdam caused 457 deaths between June and December,
1631. Neuruppin, in February of that year, after the occupation
of the District of Ruppin by Tilly, suffered from a
severe pestilence. Dysentery and ‘head-disease’ broke out
in Rathenow in 1631, reached a climax in July, and carried
away 662 people (not including those buried in secret). In
Prenzlau 1,500 persons, about one-fourth of the population,
died in the year 1631, while Havelberg had 227 deaths,
Lindow 400, and Kyritz (after the soldiers had quartered
there) 231. Frankfurt-on-the-Oder, which had been occupied
by the Imperialists, on April 13, 1631, was captured
by Gustavus Adolphus, whereupon a severe epidemic broke
out and carried away entire families in the course of a few
days; the alleged number of deaths was 6,000. Müncheberg
(north-west of Frankfurt), Quilitz, Drossen, and Guben
were also attacked; there were 365 deaths in Quilitz and
2,000 in Drossen. In the year 1634, when the Imperialists
once more devastated the Electorate of Saxony, a severe
plague broke out in Luckau, whither many country people
had fled; the spread of the disease is said to have been
favoured by the fact that the soldiers broke into and robbed
the closed houses of the dead. In Seftenberg (near Kalau)
a plague broke out in 1630 and carried away 305 persons
that year; it remained there until 1633, and spread to many
near-by villages.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Silesia, after the devastation caused by the pestilences
of the years 1624–7, had a few years of rest. In the year
1632, however, infection was brought there from Saxony,
though only to a limited extent. On August 1, 1632, Lauban
was obliged to surrender to the Saxon garrison, so that for
ten days the city and the surrounding country were crowded
with troops; the result was that after their departure a
severe epidemic broke out and between July and December
carried away 1,400 persons. In the very next year severe
plagues broke out all over Silesia, when Wallenstein appeared
there for the purpose of driving out the Saxons and Swedes.
The plague raged so furiously in Silesia that the armies were
almost entirely exterminated, and whole communities were
wiped out. Golgau, Bunzlau (and vicinity), Greiffenberg,
and Friedeberg were attacked. An epidemic of typhus
fever carried away 500 people in Hirschberg in the year
1632, and in the following year it became much more widespread
and carried away 2,600 persons. ‘The infected persons
are said to have looked very red, like drunkards, and
to have died suddenly.’ Almost the entire population of
Landshut died in the year 1633. Goldberg (south-west of
Liegnitz) had been plundered by Wallenstein’s soldiers on
October 4 and 5, 1633, and on October 10 Colonel Sparre
quartered 200 ‘badly infected’ soldiers there; the result
was that a severe pestilence broke out in the city. In
August of the year 1633 such a severe pestilence broke out
in Liegnitz that it was impossible to bury the victims in the
regular way; deep, broad ditches were dug, and from 100
to 200 bodies laid in them. From August 14 to December 22
the number of deaths is said to have been 5,794. Breslau,
which at that time had upwards of 40,000 inhabitants, was
visited by a plague in September 1633; in the Protestant
parishes 13,231 people died in that year, in the Catholic
4,800. Neumarkt (north-west of Breslau) had 1,400 deaths
in the same year, while in Brieg, which had a Swedish
garrison, there were 3,439 deaths. The city of Schweidnitz
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>suffered terribly; 30,000 soldiers under Wallenstein and
25,000 Swedish soldiers were encamped there, and the plague
was so severe that 8,000 of the former and 12,000 of the
latter are said to have died. In the city itself, which was
harbouring innumerable fugitives from the surrounding
country, sick people and dead bodies soon filled all the
streets; on August 25 alone, 300 people died. The number
of the dead, including from 2,000 to 3,000 that were buried
secretly, and also the outsiders, was 16,000 to 17,000;
more than two-thirds of the population are said to have
succumbed. The pestilence was borne from Schweidnitz to
Peterswaldau and Nimptsch, where from 2,000 to 2,400
persons died. On May 31, 1633, Wallenstein came with his
army to Glatz, bringing pestilence with him; in Glatz itself
4,284 people were carried away, while many hundreds died
in the surrounding country. Petschkau was almost completely
wiped out. In Neisse the number of victims is estimated
at 6,000; 5,272 are recorded in the church registers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Generally speaking, Thuringia was but slightly affected
by plagues in the years 1631–3, but suffered terribly in the
years 1634–5; for in those years there, as in all Germany,
a great famine prevailed. In Koburg a plague broke out
in the year 1630; in 1632 there was an epidemic of ‘head-disease’,
which carried away 300 persons in October alone,
and in 1634 an epidemic of bubonic plague, rendered even
more destructive by famine, carried away 1,143 victims.
Several pestilences (dysentery and ‘burning fever’) also
broke out in the Koburg region, caused by the quartering
and ravaging of Swedish troops; the inhabitants died by
hundreds. Hildburghausen suffered from a plague from
June on; whereas only 106 people had died there from
January to May, the number of deaths in June alone was
215. In the following year 534 people died there from starvation
and pestilence, while 169 died in near-by Streufdorf.
Eisfeld (west of Hildburghausen) in 1632 had been plundered
by Swedish troops, and from that time on suffered from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>pestilence. In Meiningen, in the latter part of 1635 and
the first part of 1636, 500 people succumbed to a plague
(106 in November alone). Suhl, which on October 16 had
been burned by Isolani’s soldiers, and Themar—both near
Meiningen—had 1,634 deaths. In the following year 519
people died in Schmalkalden and vicinity—250 in Tambach,
300 in Vachdorf, and 1,600 in Salzungen. In the year 1634
the number of deaths in Eisenach was 1,800, and in the
following year 1,600; in the year 1636 there were only
405 deaths there. Erfurt suffered very little in 1635, while
Ohrdruf had 1,065 deaths, Wechmar 503, and Arnstadt
464. In Weimar 1,600 people died in the year 1635, among
them 500 foreigners from Franconia who had taken refuge
there. The cities lying further east in Thuringia had been
severely attacked in the years 1632 and 1633, in consequence
of the pestilences in Saxony; for example, Gera,
which had been infected in 1633 by Holk’s troops, the near-by
village of Untermhaus, which in the two years had 211
and 600 deaths respectively, and also many other villages
in the surrounding country. A plague in Schleiz carried
away 600 persons in the year 1632.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Rhineland and Westphalia pestilences broke out only
sporadically in the years 1630–4, but in 1635 they became
more general. In the year 1630 Münster was attacked, in
1631 Arnsberg, and in 1632 a pestilence raged furiously in
the Berg country—in Lennep, for example, where the
Imperialist troops were for a long time quartered. In
Mühlheim-on-the-Rhine a pestilential disease broke out after
the departure of the Nassau-Lorraine garrison in 1631. In the
year 1632 the Imperialist and Swedish armies stood facing
each other in Westphalia for six weeks, and the result was
an outbreak of pestilence; 600 people succumbed to it in
Bielefeld. In 1635 a pestilence raged furiously along the
Rhine; in St. Goar 200 people died in the course of the
summer. In that year Westphalia was the scene of warlike
events and pestilences; Arnsberg, the villages on the Ruhr,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Soest, Unna (near Hamm), Horstmar, and Kroesfeld were
attacked. The Governmental District of Düsseldorf (on
the left bank of the Rhine) was severely attacked by
pestilence; many people died in Geldern, while there were
389 deaths in Strälen, 256 in Nieukert, and 700 in Lobberich.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>2. <em>South Germany</em></h4>

<h5 class='c014'><em>(a) Bavaria and Upper Swabia</em></h5>

<p class='c013'>After the battle of Breitenfeld (September 17, 1631)
Gustavus Adolphus passed through Halle and Erfurt to
Würzburg, Aschaffenburg, and Frankfurt-on-the-Main.
Tilly had marched through Halberstadt, Fulda, and Miltenberg
to Würzburg, in order to relieve that city, which had
been captured by the Swedes, and then turned south. Thus
the principal scene of the war was transferred to Bavaria,
which from 1631 to 1634 suffered terribly from the ravages
of the soldiers passing back and forth. No part of the
country was spared. ‘The Thirty Years’ War’, says Lammert,<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c011'><sup>[34]</sup></a>
‘was particularly fatal and disastrous to Bavaria
from the year 1632 on; it converted the country into an
uninhabited waste, especially because it was followed by
pestilence. Like the Imperialist army under Tilly in the
autumn of 1631, so the Swedish army on its marches consumed
everything it found, and wherever it went in the
years 1632–5 it spread ‘hunger typhus’ and ‘war typhus’
and bubonic plague; all the places along the Main lost at
least one-half of their population.’ In September 1632,
when Gustavus Adolphus withdrew from Nuremberg,
Wallenstein turned south, and there on November 6, 1632,
Gustavus Adolphus was killed in the battle of Lützen. After
that Wallenstein returned to Bohemia, while the Swedes
under Bernhard von Weimar marched back into Bavaria.
The acme of misery was reached here in the year 1634. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>is impossible to enumerate all the places that were infected
by the brutalized, wandering soldiers; the most out-of-the-way
and indigent regions, such as the Spessart and the
Odenwald, were visited by them, and inasmuch as they
brought pestilence wherever they went, the unfortunate
villages were subjected to merciless devastation.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. The region of the Main. Since Gustavus Adolphus
first had Horn occupy the bishopric of Bamberg, and himself
marched through Aschaffenburg to Nuremberg, while Tilly
returned to Ingolstadt and later to Lech, the region of the
Main, and later the region north of the Danube, were the
first to be attacked by typhus fever and bubonic plague;
not until later, from 1633 on, did the pestilences spread
more or less extensively in the country south of the Danube.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Aschaffenburg and vicinity a plague broke out in the
summer of 1632 and almost wiped out several villages; the
city of Aschaffenburg itself, which lost a large percentage
of its inhabitants, was revisited in the year 1635. In Würzburg
the pestilence began in August 1632, and in the last
part of July of the following year another serious pestilence
broke out there, in consequence of which 489 bodies were
buried in the cathedral parish alone. The prolonged quartering
of troops, notwithstanding all the precautionary
measures that were adopted, caused the pestilence to rage
with extraordinary fury; not until September did it begin
to abate. In the year 1635, when infected soldiers were
transferred from Schweinfurt to the stronghold of Marienburg,
it appeared once more. In 1632 Schweinfurt lost
‘several hundred people’ in consequence of ‘pestilential
purple-spots’ (typhus fever). The total number of deaths
was 1,055. In December of the following year another
rather large pestilence broke out, and again in August 1635;
in the latter year it reached a climax in September and came
to an end in December. In Bamberg many people succumbed
in 1632 to Hungarian disease, which the Swedes had
borne thither in the spring. This disease was also very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>widespread throughout the entire vicinity. In the year
1634 the Swedes came several times into the region around
Bamberg and plundered the country, so that famine and
plague caused great misery. In the summer of 1635 Bamberg
was once more attacked by an infectious disease (typhus
fever), and only two houses in the city were spared. In
Kulmbach the plague raged extensively in the first part of
the year 1633; the number of the dead was so large that
the bodies could not all be buried in Kulmbach, and some
had to be taken to the churchyards of near-by villages. In
the following year the plague broke out anew, carrying away
60 persons in a single day. In Bayreuth 400 persons succumbed
to a pestilence in the year 1632, and in the following
year 360 died; it raged even more furiously after the city
was plundered by the Master of Ordnance, von der Waal,
on August 19, 1634. From July to October 1,927 out of
7,000 inhabitants died, while the average number of deaths
amounted to only 167 per annum.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The region between the Main and the Danube suffered
no less. Nuremberg and vicinity was severely attacked by
pestilence in the year 1632. In the summer of that year
Wallenstein encamped near Fürth, and Gustavus Adolphus
near Nuremberg; they watched each other for a long time
without venturing a battle. The country people had all
fled to the city. In the Swedish army and in the overcrowded
city, which had some 50,000 inhabitants, scurvy
and typhus fever carried away many thousands.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c011'><sup>[35]</sup></a> Only
4,522 bodies were buried by the Church, but many more
thousands died. Two weeks after his disastrous attack on
Wallenstein’s camp on September 4, Gustavus Adolphus
marched south, while Wallenstein turned into Saxony. The
plague continued to rage in the vicinity of Nuremberg, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>many people contracted the disease by visiting the deserted
camp of the Imperialist army and appropriating the left-behind
implements, weapons, and kitchen utensils. Scurvy
was still raging in Nuremberg in the following year. In
the year 1634 the plague broke out and carried away 18,000
persons. In December 1631 Forchheim was besieged by
the Swedes under General Horn, and the result was that
a pestilence broke out in the year 1632 and carried away
578 inhabitants; the average number of deaths per annum
was 45. In March of that year the Swedes had deserted
the city, and in June 1634, when they reappeared there, the
mortality increased again. In the years 1631–2 Uffenheim
suffered a great deal from the predatory raids of the Swedes
and also from plague, which in the year 1634 became very
widespread there as in all Bavaria, carrying away one-half
of the inhabitants of the town. While the Swedes and
Imperialists were establishing their camps near Nuremberg,
many people from Ansbach and other places fled to Windsheim,
which thus became greatly overcrowded; the consequence
was that people died there by the hundred, and
their bodies were buried, thirty or forty at a time, in large
ditches. When the Swedes left Nuremberg and appeared
in Windsheim, they left behind them 450 men who were
infected with disease; in the entire year 1,564 bodies were
counted. In the following year the city was besieged by
the Imperialists (October 12–23, 1633), and during this time
360 persons succumbed to a pestilential disease; the number
of deaths in the entire year, including the outsiders, was
1,600. Windsheim also suffered greatly in the two following
years; at the end of the year 1635 there were only 50
inhabitants left. In near-by Burgbernheim, where typhus
fever raged in the year 1630, 155 persons died in the year
1632, 165 in 1634, and 107 in 1636. In Schwabach, which
had been plundered by the Imperialists in the latter part of
July, 1632, various diseases broke out—‘Hungarian disease,
dysentery, and even bubonic plague.’ In the year 1633
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>there were 298 deaths in Weissenburg; in 1634, on the
other hand, there were 642. Eichstätt had 494 deaths in
the year 1632, 827 in 1633, and 982 in 1634; in the last year
the town was besieged and captured by the Swedes, and
for a few days thereafter pestilences raged furiously. The
country districts throughout Central Franconia, like these
cities, were almost completely depopulated by flight and
pestilence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Upper Palatinate was also severely attacked by
pestilence (typhus fever and bubonic plague), which spread
far into the Bavarian Forest. In Amberg an epidemic of
typhus fever and dysentery broke out in the year 1633, and
in April of the following year bubonic plague appeared; the
latter disease carried away from 15 to 20 persons on many
days of that month, while in July and August as many as
40 people died every day. In the spring of 1634 Weiden
became infected with typhus fever and shortly after that with
bubonic plague; from August 17 to November 6, some 1,800
people died. The bodies were corded up like piles of wood,
placed in ditches in groups of 200 and 300, and covered
with quick-lime. In Schwandorf (north of Regensburg)
the Imperialists had encamped in the summer of 1634;
after their departure a pestilence characterized by ‘swellings
and large unknown spots’ broke out and carried away
almost one-third of the inhabitants. In Hemau (north-west
of Regensburg), after the Swedes had passed through the
town, ‘the malignant pestilence’ (typhus fever) had broken
out in the year 1633; and in 1634, after the devastations
committed by the troops of Bernhard von Weimar, bubonic
plague appeared and carried away one-half of the inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. The cities on the Danube. In the year 1632 Neuburg
was occupied by the Swedes; after their departure, on
October 18, an epidemic of Hungarian head-disease broke
out and carried away many soldiers and citizens (more than
900 in eight months). Again in the two following years
pestilence caused great devastation. On April 29, 1632, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Swedes appeared before Ingolstadt, but in a few days
withdrew; there was a strong garrison in the city, however,
and many fugitives had gathered there. In this overcrowded
population typhus fever broke out and carried away large
numbers of people. In the following year the disease became
even more widespread, and 1,039 people succumbed to it
before the end of November. In the first part of the year
1635 the pestilence abated. In the second half of the year
1634 Regensburg was attacked by bubonic plague, and
despite all measures of precaution it carried away two-thirds
of the population (according to other reports there
were 3,125 deaths). The entire vicinity suffered from the
plague. The mortality in Straubing during the siege of the
Imperialists (March 1634) increased greatly; even in the
year before it had been very high (294 deaths). The total
number of deaths in the year 1634 is not known, but of three
parishes St. Jacob’s alone had 631 burials. Deggendorf and
Passau fared similarly.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Upper Bavaria and Lower Bavaria south of the Danube.
On May 17, 1632, Gustavus Adolphus had occupied Munich,
and during his short sojourn of three weeks apparently no
epidemic diseases made their appearance among the Swedes.
But since typhus fever had broken out everywhere in the
vicinity, strict measures of precaution were adopted by the
city authorities. According to G. von Suttner<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c011'><sup>[36]</sup></a> 124 people
in the quarantine-house before the Schwabinger Tor succumbed
to ‘burning fever and headache’ between August
and the end of the year. According to a report published
in 1632 the poor people suffered in particular, while red spots,
continual headache, and later on diarrhoea, characterized
the disease. A very severe pestilence broke out in Munich
in the year 1634. ‘The epidemic was caused’, says Seitz,<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c011'><sup>[37]</sup></a>
‘by the arrival of 4,000 Spanish soldiers in July of the year
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>1634; they were called there from Tölz and Weilheim when
the Duke of Saxe-Weimar and General Horn were threatening
the city. Although shortly after that, in August, a few
evidences of disease were noticed, it was not regarded as
infectious. Finally, however, a real plague broke out with
such fury that four lazarets and a garden outside of the
city had to be made ready for the care of the sick. It raged
most furiously in the months of October and November,
when from 200 to 250 dwellings, among them entire houses,
were quarantined every week. Thus it went on until the
end of December.’ Unfortunately there exists no medical
description of the disease, the most important characteristics
of which were chills, accompanied by internal fever, violent
headaches, great lassitude, haemorrhage, plague-spots, and
swellings. All told, some 15,000 persons are said to have
died in the year 1634—about one-half of the total population
of the city. The bodies of victims became so numerous that
they were piled up in the streets and houses, without attempt
to keep a record of the names, and buried in ditches forty at
a time. Strict isolation of the patients by closing up the
houses was enforced, and the use of the clothes and bedding
of the dead was forbidden under severe penalties; such
effects were burned outside of the gates. Only two gates
remained open, and in front of one of them a garden was
made ready to receive strangers who were denied admittance
into the city. In February 1635, the pestilence had almost
entirely ceased, but in September it broke out anew and did
not disappear until February 1637.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the years 1633–4 typhus fever and bubonic plague were
spread throughout all Upper and Lower Bavaria by the
continued marauding of the Swedes. The Imperialists, no
less than the Swedes, helped to devastate the country,
while the Spanish soldiers had the worst reputation of all.
Again in the year 1635, especially in the autumn, the pestilence
appeared. A plague broke out in Freising after the
town was plundered by the Swedes on July 16, 1634 (Landshut
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>had already been captured by them on May 10, 1632), and
after their departure they left behind them an infectious
disease which was diagnosed by the town-physician as
Hungarian fever. A pestilence broke out in the city when
it was plundered by the soldiers under Bernhard von Weimar,
on July 10, 1634, and carried away one-third of the inhabitants;
according to a list furnished by the court the number
of deaths was 738, but there were many more with whose
legacies the court had nothing to do. The bodies were piled
up on wagons and conveyed to cemeteries, while the dwellings
of diseased persons were closed. In Dingolfing, which was
occupied by the Swedes from July 22, 1633, to June 1634,
a plague raged with such fury that it was thought the city
would be completely wiped out. Simbach-on-the-Inn and
the near-by market-town of Thann suffered greatly from
a plague in the year 1634. In Thann many bodies lay for
a long time in the houses unburied, while entire families
among the poorer population were wiped out of existence.
The plague also raged in the surrounding localities, and many
bodies lay in the streets as food for scavenger birds. A plague
raged in the years 1633–4 in Traunstein, which had already
had a few isolated cases of disease in the previous year;
123 people died terrible deaths in the two years mentioned,
and also in the years 1635–6. In the year 1634 a pestilence
caused 500 deaths in Rosenheim, while severe outbreaks of
pestilence were reported from many surrounding places—Aibling,
Miesbach, Wasserburg, and Tegernsee.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Tölz twenty-seven adults succumbed in May and June
1633, to Hungarian disease; a pestilence also broke out in
the spring of 1634 and carried away hundreds of people in the
months of May, June, and July. From July on, the church-registers
contain no more entries; the patients with black
swellings usually had but a few hours to live. In Oberammergau
‘wild headache’ raged in the years 1631 and 1633,
and many people succumbed to it. In September 1634, the
town became infected with bubonic plague, and up to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>October 28, eighty-four people succumbed to the disease—about
one-fifth of the population. The epidemic caused the
people to vow that they would produce the Passion Play
there every ten years. Murnau, Weilheim, and other places
were severely attacked in the year 1634. In Andechs the
mortality was increased in the year 1634 by an outbreak of
dysentery and typhus fever, and on July 27 bubonic plague
also appeared and remained until November, carrying away
200 of the 500 inhabitants of the town. In Landsberg
typhus fever broke out very seriously in the year 1630. ‘All
over the bodies of the people who contracted the disease’,
says Lammert,<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c011'><sup>[38]</sup></a> ‘red spots appeared, and then the victims
lost control of themselves and knocked their heads against
the walls. Many who seemed scarcely to have contracted
the disease died suddenly. Dead bodies were found everywhere,
even in public squares.’ In the following year the
disease spread even further; the vicinity of Landsberg was
infected by the soldiers, who were constantly marching
back and forth. After the terrible plundering of the city in
April and September of the year 1633, a plague broke out
and carried away a large proportion of the few inhabitants
that were left.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. The governmental district of Swabia fared no better
than the aforesaid Bavarian countries, while the region on
the northern side of the Lake of Constance suffered terribly
from the predatory raids of the Swedes and the consequent
epidemics. In Augsburg, which from April 1632 to 1635
was occupied by the Swedes, the suffering began when the
city was besieged by the Imperialists. During a siege of
seven months (September 1634 to March 1635) famine and
pestilence did a great deal more damage among the population
than the bullets and swords of the enemies. Whereas
this population numbered from 70,000 to 80,000 in the year
1624, by October 12, 1635, it had dwindled to 16,422. After
the city had surrendered to the Imperialists, people still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>continued to die in consequence of pestilential diseases; the
town council therefore gave orders on July 7, 1635, that all
refuse should be removed from the city. Not until the winter
did the pestilence disappear. In Memmingen there were
1,200 deaths in 1633, and 1,400 deaths in the following year;
the worst year was 1635, when the pestilence is said to have
carried away 3,000 persons. The towns surrounding the
city were also severely attacked. In Kempten, which was
oppressed by the Swedes and Imperialists in the years 1632–3,
a pestilence broke out in the year 1634 and lasted well into
the next year, carrying away 3,000 people. In the surrounding
country, pestilence raged so furiously that many places
were completely wiped out. In the near-by towns of Kaufbeuren,
Immenstadt, Pfronten, Füssen, &amp;c., the pestilence
was likewise very widespread; in 1635 there were 1,600
deaths in Füssen—about one-quarter of the inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c007'>The predatory incursions of the Swedes extended even to
the Lake of Constance. In the year 1634 the number of
deaths in Lindau was 800; at the beginning of the year 1633
Weingarten, Wangen, and Tettnang were occupied by the
Swedes, who brought infectious diseases with them wherever
they went. Tettnang, which in 1633 had more than 2,500
inhabitants, in 1636 had but 150. In Ravensburg a plague
broke out in the year 1635, reached a climax in September,
and in six months carried away 3,100 people. In Constance
Hungarian disease raged in 1633, and is said to have carried
away its victims within a few hours; in 1635 bubonic
plague also broke out and caused 2,000 deaths.</p>

<h5 class='c014'><em>(b.) South-western Germany</em></h5>

<p class='c013'>The battle of Nördlingen (September 5 and 6, 1634) was
an important turning-point in the war, important for
Bavaria for the reason that it freed the country from the
predatory incursions of the Swedes, and disastrous to
Württemberg, Baden, Hessen, and the Upper and Middle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Rhine region, whither the defeated Swedish-Protestant army
retreated, and where the fighting was now carried on for
the next few years. Nördlingen had been besieged by the
Imperialists, who were supported by a Spanish army;
Bernhard von Weimar and Horn tried to relieve the city,
but were completely defeated in the attempt. The Swedes
turned and fled to the Rhine, and in a few weeks the entire
south-western part of Germany was filled with Imperialists
who had followed in pursuit.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sufferings of the inhabitants of Württemberg, partly
on account of the deeds of violence committed by the
Imperialists, and partly on account of pestilences, were
frightful.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c011'><sup>[39]</sup></a> On September 10 the Imperialists entered
Stuttgart, which they continued to occupy until March 30,
1638. In the year 1631 the city had 8,300 inhabitants, and
in the year 1634 the number of deaths was 936, of which
672 were due to the pestilence. In the following year the
pestilence became more widespread, being helped along by
numerous fugitives from the surrounding country and by
famine; the number of deaths was 4,379, and it was necessary
to dig large ditches and bury a hundred bodies at a time.
From January to July 1636, there were 319 deaths due to
the pestilence, which in the following year raged even more
furiously and carried away 945 persons. The mortality was
equally high in the year 1638, when the city was occupied
alternately by the Swedes and Imperialists; the latter,
when they departed in October, left behind them 6,000
diseased and wounded men. In near-by Cannstatt 1,300
people died in 1635. In Esslingen a plague broke out in
1634 and in 1635 became more and more widespread in
consequence of the continual marching back and forth of
the soldiers. It made havoc especially among the 12,000
fugitives from the surrounding country, who were packed
together in stables and barns, and in many cases under the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>open sky. Owing to the incipient famine the pestilence
spread with great rapidity; 12,000 people are said to have
died, among them 600 out of 1,000 citizens, notwithstanding
the fact that various measures of precaution were adopted
(removal of refuse, fumigations on a large scale, &amp;c.). In
Göppingen, which was occupied by Imperialist soldiers
a few weeks after the battle of Nördlingen, pestilence soon
broke out and carried away 656 persons between October 1
and the end of the year (1634); in the following year there
were 904 deaths. In the year 1636 Gmünd had a very
severe pestilence, which on many days carried away from
thirty to forty persons; large graves were dug and from
forty to fifty bodies buried at a time. Aalen, in consequence
of the continual marching back and forth of the soldiers, of
quartering, and of extortions, suffered severely; there, and
in the country round about, a plague raged furiously in the
year 1634. Krailsheim and Hall, comparatively speaking,
fared well. In Hall, the parish of St. Michael, in which the
average number of deaths for the years 1621–30 was 112, in
the year 1634 had 1,116 deaths (999 in the months of August-December),
while there were 372 deaths in the year 1635.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c011'><sup>[40]</sup></a>
The fugitives in the city and the people who died there are
not included. In Oehringen, after the town was plundered
by the Imperialists from September 13 to 18, a very severe
pestilence broke out and carried away 1,131 persons. The
neighbouring towns and villages also had a great many
deaths due to pestilence—Neuenstein 1,100, Waldenburg 452,
and Künzelsau 900. The entire Hohenlohe Plateau was
severely attacked by pestilence; in the little town of Grossbottwar,
first ‘head-disease’ broke out in 1635, then dysentery,
and finally bubonic plague; between the months of July
and December 692 persons succumbed to these three diseases.
In June 1635, there were 775 deaths in Lauffen-on-the
Neckar, 1,609 in Heilbronn, 646 in Weinsberg (out of 1,416
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>inhabitants), 1,802 in Vaihingen (only 48 in 1631), and 1,019
in Bönnigheim (among them many outsiders).</p>

<p class='c007'>In the towns on the Upper Neckar and on the northern
border of the Swabian Alp a very severe pestilence likewise
broke out. Nürtingen was devastated by the Imperialists
after the battle of Nördlingen, and in the years 1634–5 there
were 1,154 deaths in consequence of a pestilence. The
surrounding country also fared badly; for example, Urach
and the near-by Alp villages. In the year 1634 a plague broke
out in Tübingen, and in the following year it spread widely
in consequence of famine, compelling the university faculty
to leave the city. The highest mortality was reached in
October (386 deaths), while the total number of deaths for
the entire year was 1,485. The plague raged no less furiously
in Rottenburg-on-the-Neckar. Nor was the Swabian Alp
spared; in the village of Gruibingen there were 90 deaths
in 1634 and eighty-six deaths in the year 1635. Böhmenkirch
was almost completely wiped out. In Gussenstadt, whither
many inhabitants of the surrounding country had fled, the
usual mortality per annum was 12 or 14; in the year 1634
there were 313 deaths up to December 7, while in the year
1635 there were 137 deaths up to September 23. In the months
of November and December (1634) alone there were 157
deaths, and the inhabitants frequently died at the rate of
4–6 per diem.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c011'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>After the battle of Nördlingen thousands of the inhabitants
of the surrounding country fled to Ulm, where epidemics
had broken out in the year 1634 and carried away 1,871
persons. In June 1635, the general misery caused a plague
to break out there; in the morning many dead bodies would
be found lying in the streets and in front of houses. In the
course of eight months 15,000 persons were carried away,
among them 4,033 fugitives and 5,672 beggars; in the
following year only 496 persons died, all told. Even the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Black Forest district of Württemberg suffered in consequence
of the war and of pestilence; Tuttlingen in the year 1635
had 546 deaths, Calw 772, and Freudenstadt 434; Neuenburg,
Nagold, Sulz, and other places were also attacked.</p>

<p class='c007'>How terrible was the loss of human life in Württemberg in
consequence of the war and of pestilence is shown by the
fact that the population of the city decreased from 444,800
in the year 1622 to 97,300 in the year 1639; the population
in 1634 was 414,536. In the short period of five years
(1634–9), in consequence of the invasion of the Imperialists
after the battle of Nördlingen, and of the pestilence and famine
caused thereby, the country lost 300,000 inhabitants, or
about three-fourths of its population.</p>

<p class='c007'>The northern part of Baden suffered severely in the years
1634–6; Pforzheim lost at least one-third of its inhabitants
in consequence of famine and pestilence, while Durlach and
Mannheim are also reported to have been attacked.</p>

<p class='c007'>That part of Hessen lying on the right side of the Rhine
was likewise visited by pestilence. In Wimpfen-on-the-Neckar
a plague broke out in August, 1635, and in the period
between August 12 and December 31 there were 494 deaths
there. Bensheim, Zwingenberg, Gernsheim, Babenhausen,
and Seligenstadt fared no better. Darmstadt, with 212
deaths in 1633 and 220 deaths in 1634, had an increased
mortality, but in 1635 some 2,200 bodies are said to have
been buried there; at first it was ‘head-disease’, and afterwards
‘a poisonous pestilence’.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Lower Main region suffered terribly in the year 1635
from famine and pestilence; the Wetterau, the Palatinate,
and Alsace-Lorraine were all attacked. Frankfurt-on-the-Main
had been occupied by the Swedes in the latter part of
1631, and after that the mortality increased; whereas in
the years 1630–2 the average number of deaths was 1,598, in
1633 it increased to 3,512, in 1634 to 3,421, and in 1635 to
6,943. This includes all the Protestant population, only
a part of the Catholic population, and none of the Jews.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>The large number of country-people who had fled to the city
rendered the general condition worse and helped to spread
the pestilence. The worst month was September 1635, in
which 1,112 persons died. According to a Frankfurt physician,
Hörnigk, the crisis came on the fifth or sixth day, while
many people contracted the disease not only once, but as
many as seven times.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c011'><sup>[42]</sup></a> We see from this last observation
that the various infectious diseases at that time were not
distinguished, but were regarded as different stages of one
and the same disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>In near-by Hanau, after it was occupied by the Swedes
and Hessians on October 2, 1634, famine and pestilence
appeared; in June 1635, an epidemic of bubonic plague
broke out there, reaching a climax in August, and gradually
disappearing with the beginning of the cold weather. The
mortality among the citizens and fugitives was very great,
but the statement that 21,000 people died in Hanau is
perhaps an exaggeration. Upper Hesse was devastated in
1635 by famine and pestilence; in Giessen, for example,
1,503 people died (according to the grave-diggers’ records),
and in Lich, a small fortified town, there were 1,225 deaths,
including 22 soldiers and 549 fugitives from the surrounding
country.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Rhenish Palatinate, after it was occupied by the
Imperialists, conditions were terrible; famine and pestilence
lasted from 1635 to 1639. In the year 1635 General Gallas
retreated from Dieuze to the Rhine, and in the same year
serious diseases broke out there (dysentery, typhus fever, &amp;c.),
so that the streets and fields were covered with the bodies
of his soldiers. Wherever he went these diseases were transmitted
to the local inhabitants, so that many places lost
more than half of their population. Pestilence was also
transmitted to other cities and towns in the Palatinate;
in Zweibrücken, which had 3,000 inhabitants, 250 married
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>persons died between August 1, 1635, and April 1, 1636;
many villages in the vicinity were entirely depopulated.
In Kaiserslautern, which on August 17, 1635, was stormed
by the Imperialists under General Hatzfeld, and was thereafter
subjected to an inhuman sacking, a severe plague broke out
in the year 1636 and carried away large numbers of people.
In Worms numerous people succumbed that year to dysentery.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Alsace an epidemic of bubonic plague broke out in
August 1636; it had been brought there by the troops of
the Count-Palatine von Birkenfeld and became very widespread
among the fugitives in the overcrowded city of
Strassburg. From thirty to forty bodies were buried in
a single day, and in the entire year there were 5,546 deaths,
including 1,000 fugitives and soldiers. The disease continued
to reveal its presence until the next spring, and by that time
8,000 persons are said to have died in Strassburg. In the
year 1635–6, owing to the perpetual condition of war, which
made it impossible to cultivate the fields, there ensued
a terrible famine, and this did a great deal to further the
dissemination of pestilence. Zabern, where there was a strong
garrison, and where many soldiers were quartered, suffered
terribly in the year 1634, and again in the years 1635–6
widespread pestilences broke out; in 1636 the Imperialists
died there ‘like cattle’.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lorraine also suffered terribly. In the year 1635 Bernhard
von Weimar and Cardinal La Valette were obliged to retreat
before Gallas to the vicinity of Metz, where they arrived on
October 1; the troops brought fever, dysentery, and ‘Swedish
plague’ with them; the last-named disease, which has
been held to be typhus fever, became more widespread in
Metz in the year 1636 than it had ever been before—it was
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la plus meurtrière et la plus désastreuse des temps modernes
dans notre pays</span></i>.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c011'><sup>[43]</sup></a> The precautionary measures of the city
administration—cleaning of the streets, isolation of the
patients, closing of infected houses—were of no avail. Many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>bodies were cast into the Mosel, and before the gates of the
city the streets and fields were covered with dead men and
horses. Also in the neighbouring cities, especially in Verdun
and Nancy, the losses in consequence of the pestilence were
great.</p>

<p class='c007'>Conditions were equally bad in the adjacent Luxemburg.
‘The French as enemies,’ says Lammert,<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c011'><sup>[44]</sup></a> ‘the Croats,
Hungarians, and Poles as defenders, committed the most
terrible devastations in the country through which they
passed. Famine, poverty, and a furious pestilence completed
the misery. Entire villages were wiped out; in the city
of Luxemburg the churchyards no longer had room for the
bodies, and places for burial had to be prepared within the
fortifications. Throughout the entire province 11,000 persons,
one-third of the inhabitants, lost their lives.’</p>

<p class='c007'>In the year 1637 Count Bernhard von Weimar transferred
the scene of the war into southern Baden, where, during the
siege of Breisach, from July 5 to December 18, 1638, an
epidemic of scurvy caused increased misery. In the year
1639 large numbers of people in the Lörrach district were
carried away by the pestilence, among them Count Bernhard
himself.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><em>3. North Germany (1636–40)</em></h4>

<p class='c013'>In North Germany the war against the Imperialists was
continued by the Swedes under Banner. On October 4, 1636,
the Imperialists were defeated at Wittstock (province of
Brandenburg, district of East Priednitz), whereupon the
Swedes in that very same year overran Saxony and Thuringia.
In 1637, to be sure, they were thrown back into Pomerania
by Gallas, but in 1638 they reappeared in Saxony, and in
1639 won a brilliant victory at Chemnitz. Thereupon
Banner undertook a campaign into Bohemia, whence, in
1641, he was forced to retire. Shortly afterwards (May 10,
1641) he died in Halberstadt.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>These campaigns spread severe pestilences throughout the
above-mentioned regions of North Germany, particularly
the southern part of Brandenburg and the modern province
of Saxony. The largest part of the Altmark resembled
a ‘large lazaret’; in Wittstock itself there were 305 deaths
in the year 1636, in Bismark 163, and in Salzwedel 193;
in Werben a plague broke out after the soldiers had been
quartered there and lasted well into the next year. In
Stendal it began in June 1636, and carried away 1,992
persons in that year, as compared with an average annual
mortality of 120–30; nor does the number include the
peasants that had fled to the city, 3,000 of whom died.
The pestilence spread over the entire vicinity and wiped out
whole villages. In Tangermünde a pestilence broke out
even before the battle of Wittstock; it was borne thither by
Imperialists and Saxon artillerymen. In Gardelegen, where
Banner had his head-quarters, 500 people in the parish of
St. Nicholas, and 1,205 in the parish of St. Mary, succumbed
in the year 1636 to bubonic plague and other diseases,
among the dead being 195 soldiers. In Neuhaldensleben,
whither many country-people had fled, a plague broke out
in May 1636, and spread throughout the entire vicinity;
in many days in September, thirty and more bodies were
counted, while the incomplete church register records 778
deaths. The total number of deaths is said to have been
2,560.</p>

<p class='c007'>Typhus fever and other infectious diseases raged furiously
in Magdeburg, and, as before, the country south-west of
Magdeburg also suffered. In Gross-Salze, which had received
many fugitives, 701 persons succumbed in the year 1636 to
dysentery and bubonic plague, among them 329 outsiders;
the climax of the pestilence occurred in July, when there
were 162 deaths. In Egeln, as in Gross-Salze, a plague broke
out in May 1636, carrying away 164 persons (134 of them
outsiders) in June, 63 natives and 84 outsiders in July. In
Wolmirsleben a pestilence raged from April to the middle of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>September 1636, and carried away 130 people. In Atzendorf
typhus fever and bubonic plague broke out in the spring
of the year 1636 and carried away 617 persons, inclusive of
outsiders. In Wanzleben 600 persons succumbed in the year
1636 to bubonic plague, and 300 to other diseases and starvation.
In Aschersleben a pestilence broke out on April 2, 1636,
reached a climax in November with 217 deaths, and carried
away, all told, 1,125 persons in that year (including 499 outsiders
and soldiers). In Zerbst, where infected soldiers were
quartered, the epidemic was particularly widespread; of
the fugitives in the city 1,500 succumbed. In Wittenberg
and vicinity dysentery and typhus fever broke out in the
year 1636, and in the fall of that year bubonic plague also
made its appearance and lasted well into the following year,
carrying away thousands of people. In Merseburg, in the
parish of St. Maximus alone, there were 942 deaths in
the years 1636–7, and in Eisleben there were 1,598 deaths
(including the outsiders) in the year 1636. Halle and
vicinity, in the summer of 1636, had an outbreak of ‘spotted
fever with dysentery’ and bubonic plague; the number of
deaths was not less than 3,440.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Thuringia a plague raged extensively in the years 1636–7.
In Hildburghausen there were 648 deaths due to a plague
in the year 1636, in Jena 691 (not including the outsiders),
while in the year 1637 there were 307 deaths in Arnstadt and
525 in Zeitz. In many smaller places dysentery and bubonic
plague broke out, having been borne there by soldiers and
wandering beggars.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Saxony (present kingdom) pestilences reappeared after
the invasion of Banner in the year 1637. In Leipzig a great
many homeless people took refuge; within three months
2,500 persons died there, and in the entire year 4,229 out
of 15,000 inhabitants succumbed to various diseases. Pestilences
also broke out with renewed strength in near-by
cities and towns; by September 1,000 natives and 2,000
outsiders died in Grimma. In Leisnig, fever, ‘head-disease’,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>and diarrhoea appeared. After the burning of the city by
the Swedes, a plague broke out and carried away 2,200
persons in six months, including the outsiders. Colditz,
which had suffered great losses in the last six years, had 352
deaths; the population so dwindled away that in the year
1638 it amounted to only 28. In Döbeln there were 674
deaths, in Oschatz 2,000 (including the outsiders), and in
Mügeln more than 1,000. The near-by cities, belonging to
the governmental district of Merseburg, also had a very
high mortality; in Belgern there were 765 deaths, in Delitsch
881 deaths, while in Eilenburg 8,000 natives and outsiders
are said to have died. In Dresden, where in the year 1635
only 79 persons had died in consequence of plague, there
were 1,097 deaths in the year 1637. In the following years,
moreover, cases of plague continued to appear. A high
mortality prevailed even in the Saxon Erzgebirge, caused for
the most part by typhus fever.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Brandenburg a severe pestilence raged in the years
1637–8. Berlin was repeatedly attacked in 1637 and again
in 1639. In Spandau it raged very extensively, and lasted
well into the following year. In Luckau 500 inhabitants
died in the year 1637. The pestilence was conveyed to Neu-Ruppin
by an infected soldier, and in the church register
of that town 600 deaths are recorded. In Gransee a pestilence
broke out in May 1638, and in a short time carried away
1,000 persons. Four neighbouring villages were completely
wiped out. In Wittstock 1,599 persons succumbed in the
year 1638 to bubonic plague and other diseases, and in Pritzwalk
1,500 people died (not including the soldiers and
fugitive country-people). In Lychen (district of Templin)
numerous fugitives and two-thirds of the native inhabitants
died. In Angermünde, but 40 out of 700 families were left,
and in Prenzlau a pestilence likewise raged furiously.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pomerania, while the war was going on between the
Swedes and Imperialists, fared no better. In Massow 400
persons succumbed to a plague. In Ueckermünde, in consequence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>of a plague caused by the capture of the city by
the Swedes, only eight men and seven widows are said to
have survived the year 1638.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mecklenburg suffered terribly in the years 1637–8 from the
quartering of Swedish troops there. Thousands succumbed
in a short time to dysentery and bubonic plague, especially
in the months of August and September 1638. Güstrow,
in the year 1637, is said to have lost 2,000 persons (most of
them doubtless fugitive country-people). Sternberg, the
population of which was completely wiped out by the
pestilence, stood empty for half a year. In New Brandenburg,
where many country-people had taken refuge,
8,000 people died in the year 1638, according to the church
register. Bützow had 261 deaths.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c012'>IV. <span class='sc'>The War Years (1641–8)</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>After the death of Bernhard von Weimar and of Banner,
all centralized warfare in Germany ceased, and there began
an endless series of futile marches across the country.
The great depopulation of Germany, the difficulty of properly
nourishing the few that had survived, and the wide prevalence
of camp-fever, made it impossible to carry out any more
large enterprises. Severe pestilences scarcely ever occurred,
for the simple reason that there were so few people to contract
and spread diseases. Typhus fever had become epidemic
everywhere. ‘In Germany,’ says Schnurrer,<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c011'><sup>[45]</sup></a> ‘where fighting
had been going on for twenty-two years, and where soldier-life
had almost supplanted civil and rural life, a certain war-plague
revealed itself in places where there were soldiers,
and where the war had left its vestiges. This war-plague was
characterized by a mucous fever, began with a chill, accompanied
by coughing, diarrhoea, and, in the case of women,
by increased and irregular menstruation; at the same time
the tongue became dry, headache and insomnia ensued,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>and at the crisis either the brain or the throat became
inflamed, or else petechiae or purpura (then for the first
time observed in Lower Saxony) broke out. Moreover, this
war-plague, if it appeared to have passed a crisis on the
fourteenth or twenty-first day, manifested a remarkable
tendency to relapse. It was quite as infectious as bubonic
plague, and was called by several names—Hungarian fever,
head-disease, and soldiers’ disease.’ We distinctly see in
this description a mixture of various diseases (especially
typhoid fever, typhus fever, and others). Schnurrer’s
authority was Lotichius, a Frankfurt physician.</p>

<p class='c007'>The continuation of the war was disastrous to Austria,
for the reason that the Swedish general, Torstensen, pressed
on to Moravia and Lower Austria. As early as the year
1642 he had undertaken an expedition through Silesia to
Moravia and Bohemia; in the year 1644 he advanced again,
defeated the Imperialists at Jankau in Bohemia in the spring
of the year 1645, and besieged (unsuccessfully) both Vienna
and Brünn. In the year 1645 he was hard pressed by the
Austrians and compelled to evacuate Moravia and Bohemia.
Torstensen’s campaigns resulted in the outbreak of severe
pestilences throughout all Austria.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bohemia had suffered as much as Germany from the hardships
of the Thirty Years’ War, while Austrian Silesia, and
at times those parts of Austria which bordered on Bavaria,
had not been spared. Only in the year 1634 was Austria
itself attacked by pestilences, obvious consequence of the fact
that both Saxony and Bavaria were badly infected. The
incursion of Banner into Bohemia, in the year 1639, had
likewise caused a widespread epidemic.</p>

<p class='c007'>As far back as the year 1644, and hence before Torstensen’s
invasion of Austria, severe plagues broke out in Hungary,
Croatia, Upper and Lower Austria, Styria, Carinthia, and
Görz. People who contracted the disease usually died in
the first three days. Torstensen’s invasion caused the
pestilence to spread very extensively. In Vienna it broke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>out in August 1645, having been borne thither by Rakoczi’s
troops, and carried away from thirty to forty people daily.
Tuln, St. Pölten, and New Vienna are also mentioned as
places that were attacked. Styria was particularly afflicted
in the year 1646; the district of Cilli is said to have lost
10,000 inhabitants, while the city of Cilli alone had some
400 deaths. In Graz, as in all Upper Styria, the loss of human
life was not so great.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>V. War Pestilences in non-German States during the Thirty Years’ War</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>1. The Netherlands. In the summer of the year 1623
there raged in Mansfeld’s camp in East Friesland an epidemic
of typhus fever, which soon spread among the Netherlandish
troops and over the Netherlands. Antwerp, Brussels, Ypres,
Leyden, Delft, and Amsterdam were all severely attacked.
In Leyden 9,897 persons died between October 1623 and
October 1624. In Amsterdam 32,532 people died in the
year 1624, 11,795 of them in consequence of the pestilence.
In the year 1625, Breda, which for eight months had been
defended by Flemish and Walloon troops in conjunction
with the English and French, fell into the hands of the
Spaniards; famine, pestilence, and scurvy had raged so
furiously in the besieged city that 8,000 people died there,
whereas the well-nourished Spaniards did not suffer at all
from pestilence.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c011'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In the years 1635–7 typhus fever and bubonic plague
again made their appearance in the Netherlands. An
epidemic of the latter occurred in Leyden in the months
August-November 1635, and carried away 20,000 people in
the course of the entire year. The pestilence caused great
devastation in Nimeguen during the siege of the city by the
French and Dutch; in the summer of 1635 dysentery and
typhus fever broke out there, and in November bubonic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>plague appeared and slowly extended its area in the course of
the winter. From April to October 1636 it raged furiously,
and spared scarcely a single house; from August 1, 1635, to
August 1, 1636, some 6,000 persons died in the city, and the
pestilence did not come to an end until February 1637. It
also spread to the country around Nimeguen, especially
to Montfort, where half of the inhabitants succumbed
to it.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c011'><sup>[47]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>2. France. In the years 1620–30 a large part of the country
was visited by pestilence, especially the southern provinces
during the war of extermination that was carried on against
the Calvinists. In Montpellier, after the siege in 1623,
a virulent fever (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">febris maligna pestilens</span></i>) raged for eight
months, and carried away one-third of the people who contracted
it. According to Lazarus Riverius the skin became
covered with red, livid, or black spots, similar to flea-bites; they
appeared between the sixth and ninth days, and developed
for the most part on the loins, breast, and neck.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c011'><sup>[48]</sup></a> In the
years 1628–33 France experienced some very severe outbreaks
of pestilence, which undoubtedly involved bubonic plague
as well as typhus fever. Lyons had 50,000 deaths, Limoges
25,000, while Paris, Angers, Châlons, Aix, Montpellier,
Avignon, Marseilles, Agen, Dijon, Vienne, Villefranche, and
Toulouse were also attacked. In Montpellier, whither the
pestilence had been borne from Toulouse, 5,000 people
died between October 1630 and April 1631—almost one-half
of the entire population. The city of Digne, where a plague
broke out in 1629, had a terrible fate; it was completely
surrounded by soldiers, in order to prevent the plague from
spreading further, and by April 1630 some 8,500 out of
10,000 inhabitants had died.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Switzerland. The proximity of the scene of the war,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>which brought numerous fugitives into the country, and
the marching back and forth of troops through the Grisons,
resulted in numerous outbreaks of pestilence in Switzerland.
In the year 1622 some 3,000 soldiers were carried away by
an epidemic of typhus fever in the county of Mayenfeld.
Pestilences raged extensively in Switzerland in the years
1628–9. On August 5, 1628, a plague broke out in Schaffhausen,
reached its climax in October of that year, and carried
away, all told, 2,595 persons; 2,000 people died in the
country around Schaffhausen. In Zug a pestilence broke
out in September 1628 and lasted until December 1629,
carrying away 468 persons; in Sursee there were 600 deaths,
in Sempach 100, in Frauenfeld 400. In Basel the number
of deaths in the year 1629 was 2,656. In the same year
St. Gall, Toggenburg, and Altdorf were severely attacked.
In the year 1635 another pestilence broke out; the constant
misery caused by the war, and the consequent famine,
brought swarms of beggars and vagabonds from South
Germany into Switzerland, which they infected with various
diseases. The city of Zürich, for example, on June 14 of
one year was compelled to drive out 7,400 beggars. All
Switzerland was attacked by pestilence at that time, even
the most out of the way valleys.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Italy was the scene of severe pestilences in the years
1629–31; according to Ozanam they were borne there by
German troops, and according to Häser by French troops.
At all events the outbreak occurred in connexion with the
war which France was waging in Mantua against Austria
and Spain over the succession. According to a Venetian
physician, Grossi, the specific disease was not bubonic
plague; Häser,<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c011'><sup>[49]</sup></a> however, assumes that both typhus fever
and bubonic plague occurred. Lammert seems to think
that camp-fever in Upper Italy had little to do with the
high mortality. Ozanam mentions buboes, plague-sores,
inflammation of the salivary glands, and black and violet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>petechiae. Death is said to have occurred in from one to
seven days. Brescia was first attacked; after the battle
of Villabona (May 26, 1629), the pestilence, conveyed by
retreating Venetian troops, spread throughout Upper and
Central Italy. In Verona the number of deaths was 32,895,
in Milan 86,000, in Venice (1630) 45,489, (1631) 94,164, in
Mantua 25,000. In the territory of the Venetian Republic
500,000 persons are said to have succumbed to various
pestilential diseases. Genoa, Turin, Padua, Bologna, Lucca,
Florence, Parma, and other cities were also attacked.
Regarding the outbreak of pestilence in Milan, Ozanam
gives us no further information.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c011'><sup>[50]</sup></a> In October and November
isolated instances of disease occurred among people who
had acquired articles from German soldiers. Strict measures
of precaution (burning of all effects, and quarantining
of all persons who had come in contact with infected
people) prevented the pestilence from spreading. But
during the Carnival these measures were carried out less
vigorously, and the result was that in the latter part of
March 1630 a pestilence broke out in various quarters of the
city. Accordingly, two more lazarets and 800 straw huts
were erected outside the city, and shelter for relatives of
the sick was provided. Notwithstanding this, the pestilence
spread to such an extent that some 3,500 persons died
every day. In Florence, Grand Duke Ferdinand II adopted
energetic measures against the dissemination of the disease;
infected people, with or against their will, were taken to
the Hospital of San Bonifacio, where the physicians themselves
were obliged to remain. Recovered patients were
held in quarantine, and their clothes and other effects were
burned. Some 9,000 persons are said to have succumbed
to the pestilence in Florence.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. In England typhus fever repeatedly broke out after
the year 1622. In the spring of the year 1643 it appeared in
the parliamentary army and in the royal garrison during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>the siege of Reading. The disease, which is described by
Thomas Willis, spread from there to Oxford and the surrounding
country.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c011'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c012'>VI. <span class='sc'>A General Review of the Loss of Human Life in Germany during the Thirty Years’ War</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>Even if it is impossible to give an accurate numerical
account of the losses due to pestilence in the course of the
Thirty Years’ War, we have seen in a general way how
epidemics of dysentery, typhus fever, and bubonic plague
followed at the heels of armies, how they were borne from
place to place, and how the devastation of the country
caused by the war led to an absolute dearth of the necessaries
of life, and thereby helped the pestilences to spread. We
have mentioned only those places regarding which we have
specific information, and they can be regarded only as
examples of how these pestilences appeared; as a matter
of fact, however, conditions were very much the same in
all parts of the country. At the same time these examples
show satisfactorily that the great depopulation of Germany
during the Thirty Years’ War was chiefly caused by severe
epidemics of typhus fever and bubonic plague.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be of interest to assemble the figures (such as have
been recorded) relating to the number of deaths that occurred
in a few of the larger cities during the Thirty Years’ War.
We include Basel among those cities, since, being situated
close to the border of that part of Germany where the war
was carried on during two rather long periods, it was necessarily
attacked by the prevalent pestilences. At the same
time Basel affords an example of how quickly these pestilences
disappeared from the cities, even in the seventeenth
century, if external conditions permitted the authorities
to take the necessary measures of prevention and precaution,
and if the cities were not constantly being reinfected. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>give the total number of deaths, and merely remark that
the population in all German cities in the course of the
Thirty Years’ War decreased considerably. In the case of
Leipzig, Dresden, and Frankfurt-on-the-Main the still-births
are included, but not in the case of Augsburg, Basel, and
Strassburg. As a rule the country-people who fled to the
cities are not included among the dead; only in the case of
Strassburg, and perhaps also in that of Breslau for the year
1633, are they included.</p>

<p class='c007'>The total loss of human life in the Thirty Years’ War can
be estimated only approximately. The statement attributed
to Lammert, that the population of Germany, which amounted
to sixteen or seventeen millions before the war, had dwindled
down to four millions after the war, is perhaps an exaggeration.
Other estimates state that Germany lost one-half
of its population. In the case of a few states we have more
exact figures, which probably approach more closely to the
actual loss. Thus the electorate of Saxony, which was much
larger in area than the modern kingdom of Saxony, in the
years 1631–2 is said to have lost some 934,000 persons. The
population of Bohemia is said to have decreased during the
Thirty Years’ War from three millions to 780,000. In Bavaria
80,000 families are said to have been wiped out. The
population of Württemberg decreased from 444,800 in the
year 1622 to 97,300. The population of Hesse decreased
by about one-quarter. So much, however, is sure: that in
the regions where the war was carried on for several years
the population decreased by far more than one-half. The
most positive proof of this is afforded by the hundreds of
burned-down and unrebuilt houses found in so many
German cities, and the numerous unpeopled, or almost
unpeopled, places which Germany had to show at the end
of the war.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Thirty Years’ War left Germany for several decades
in such a weakened condition that Louis XIV was able to
perpetrate all sorts of outrages upon the unfortunate country.
The result was a series of protracted conflicts in the countries
on the Rhine. The German Emperor, however, was unable
to fight with much vigour, partly because of disruption in
the interior of the German Empire, and partly because the
advancing Turks were gravely menacing its eastern boundary.
After Louis XIV had come to terms with Holland in the
Peace of Nimeguen (1679), in order to secure for his protégé
the Archbishopric of Cologne, which was then vacant, he
invaded Germany without declaring war, and his troops
committed horrible devastations in the Palatinate and in
northern Baden. A German army was organized to oppose
the French, but it accomplished very little. Regarding the
pestilences of that time not much is known, although it is
certain that typhus fever was present in the armies. Thus
we learn from a physician named R. Lentilius<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c011'><sup>[59]</sup></a> that in
November 1689, ‘burning head-disease’ or ‘Hungarian
disease’ was disseminated by Bavarian soldiers who, under
Max Emanuel, had taken part in the successful siege of
Mayence (ending on September 11), and who afterwards
returned home to pass the winter. Typhus fever was conveyed
by them to Gundelfingen, Lauingen, Höchstädt,
Donauwörth, and Wendingen (all of them places on the
Danube between Ulm and Ingolstadt), causing a great many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>deaths. In many places—for example, in Gundelfingen—the
epidemic lasted well into the following year.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the very first year of the War of the Spanish Succession
(1702–14) Augsburg suffered terribly from camp-pestilences,
which also spread among the non-belligerent population.
In the year 1703 the city was occupied by the French and
Bavarians fighting as allies, and was afterwards besieged
by the Imperialists and the English.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c011'><sup>[60]</sup></a> The number of deaths
in Augsburg (excluding the still-births) was:</p>

<p class='c007'>Seitz reports that the troops along the Rhine were again
infected with petechial fever in the year 1712; Metz, on the
other hand, expressly says that no pestilences occurred at
that time.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the year 1733 a conflict again broke out between France
and Germany over the Polish succession. In the year 1734
typhus fever appeared along the Rhine; in the spring and
summer the outbreaks were sporadic, but in the fall, when
troops were stationed along both sides of the Rhine, a virulent
typhus broke out in many places, as in Heidelberg,
Heilbronn, and Germersheim; the disease was borne even
to Lorraine by French troops returning from the siege of
Philippsburg.<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c011'><sup>[61]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In connexion with the War of the Austrian Succession
(1741–8), which Maria Theresa waged in conjunction with
England and Hanover against Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony,
France, and Spain, we know of several outbreaks of pestilence.
In the year 1742 Bavaria was overrun by Austrian
troops; a severe pestilence broke out in that year in Ingolstadt
and carried away several thousand of the strong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>French garrison there. A large number of civilians also
died.<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c011'><sup>[62]</sup></a> It is stated that the French garrison at Amberg
lost 1,200 men, and that 400 of the inhabitants perished;
it is very probable that the specific disease was typhus
fever.</p>

<p class='c007'>An unusually severe epidemic broke out in the year 1742
in Prague; on November 26, 1741, the city was stormed
by the Bavarians and French, and shortly afterwards it was
besieged by the Austrians under the Grand Duke of Tuscany.
The number of men in the French garrison was 13,000, and
the siege lasted until December 25, 1742. Almost all the
French physicians and surgeons died; on the bodies of the
inhabitants of the city appeared petechiae, which, it is stated,
were not observed among the French. All told, 30,000
people are said to have been carried away by the epidemic
in Prague. The high mortality was due to the wrong treatment
of the disease by the French physicians, who held it
to be inflammatory and sought to cure it by means of drastic
phlebotomy. ‘Cette grande mortalité,’ says Ozanam, ‘fut
attribuée au traitement suivi par les médecins français, qui,
malgré l’avis de ceux du pays, saignaient les malades jusqu’à
ce qu’ils expirassent sous la lancette, et par l’abus qu’ils
firent de l’émétique qu’ils administrèrent jusqu’au 7<sup>e</sup>, 8<sup>e</sup>, 9<sup>e</sup>,
et 10<sup>e</sup> jour.’<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c011'><sup>[63]</sup></a> (The high mortality was due to the treatment
given by the French physicians, who, despite the advice of
the local physicians, bled the patients until they expired
under the lancet, and overdosed them with emetics as far
along as the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth day.) The
Prussian army in Silesia was also infected with typhus fever,
and it was not long before all the corps and the native
population were attacked.<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c011'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Austrian and English army, the so-called Pragmatic
army, which in the year 1743 operated in the region of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Main, and which on July 27, 1743, won a victory at Dettingen
(near Aschaffenburg), suffered severely, according to
Pringle<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c011'><sup>[65]</sup></a>, from dysentery and hospital fever. The hospital
for the English army was situated in the village of Fechenheim
(near Hanau); all the patients sent there, even those who
had some mild form of sickness, were infected with a camp-fever,
which according to the description must have been
typhus fever, and almost one-half of them died. The inhabitants
of the village were also attacked, and nearly all of them
succumbed. According to Neuwied, the disease was brought
there in the evacuations of the sick and carried even to
England by returning English soldiers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Seven Years’ War was attended by several epidemics
of typhus fever. Notwithstanding the long duration of the
war, they did not become very widespread, inasmuch as
the armies were comparatively small, and as the scene of the
fighting, in accordance with the military tactics of Frederick
the Great, who opposed first one and then another Power,
kept changing, and thus caused no one region to suffer for
any great length of time. A severe epidemic of typhus
fever broke out in Silesia in the year 1758; it raged in both
the Austrian and Prussian armies, and spread to many
places, for example, to Breslau, Schweidnitz, and Landshut,
where the civil inhabitants also became infected. In Breslau,
according to Grätzer,<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c011'><sup>[66]</sup></a> the number of deaths among the
evangelical population was:</p>

<p class='c007'>Typhus fever also appeared in the western scene of the
war, where the Imperialist and French troops were fighting
against the Prussians. When the united Imperialist and
French armies besieged Eisenach for two weeks, the disease
broke out in both military hospitals in the city and afterwards
spread among the inhabitants, causing many deaths.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c012'>(<em>b</em>) <span class='sc'>Eastern Europe</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>During the numerous wars that were waged in eastern
Europe in the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries, epidemic diseases frequently made their appearance.
After the siege of Vienna (1683), typhus fever broke
out in various parts of Hungary, particularly in Pressburg,
where many soldiers were congregated. The disease spread
from the soldiers to the civilians, and the pestilence lasted
from November 1683 to the spring of 1684. After the
return of the Prussian troops from Hungary, typhus fever
broke out in many parts of Germany; for example, in
Minden.<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c011'><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>At the beginning of the eighteenth century bubonic plague
broke out in Constantinople and spread from there to the
Lower Danube countries and to Russia, particularly to
Ukraine. According to Hecker,<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c011'><sup>[72]</sup></a> this dissemination was
greatly furthered by the adventurous campaign of Charles XII
of Sweden, so that the epidemic included all eastern Europe
and gradually embraced north-western Germany and Sweden.
Fleeing Swedish and Polish soldiers, after the battle of Pultowa
(July 8, 1707), conveyed the disease to Silesia. Danzig
was severely attacked in that year, and a few cases occurred
there in the year 1708; but in the following year a very
severe pestilence broke out, reached its climax in September,
and between January 5 and December 7, 1709, carried away
32,599 persons. From Danzig the plague spread to Courland,
Livonia, Pomerania, Denmark, and Sweden. In
Copenhagen 20,822 persons died in the year 1710, in Stockholm
40,000, in Karlskrona 16,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the years 1716–18, when Austria and Turkey once more
came to blows over the Turkish occupation of Morea, which
belonged to the Venetians, bubonic plague broke out in
Constantinople and also among the Turks who were shut
up in Belgrade. The Austrian army, which was encamped
outside of Belgrade, was apparently not attacked by that
disease, although some 4,000 men succumbed to intermitting
fever, head-disease, and dysentery.<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c011'><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>During the war waged by Russia and Austria against
Turkey (1736–9), bubonic plague appeared along the Lower
Danube. ‘It broke out there,’ says Häser,<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c011'><sup>[74]</sup></a> ‘first during
the war waged by Austria and Russia against Turkey, and
the result was that the war was terminated unexpectedly,
and in a manner unfavourable to the Christian arms. At
the time of its appearance in Ukraine (July 1738) the disease
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>was conveyed by Austrian troops to Temesvar; from there
it gradually spread over all Hungary, mostly along the banks
of the Theiss to the boundaries of Carniola, Moravia, and
Austria, and also along the Carpathian Mountains to Poland
and Bukowina. The devastation caused by the pestilence
continued for seven years, and the measures adopted by the
authorities proved of little or no avail.</p>

<p class='c007'>The severe epidemic of bubonic plague during the Russo-Turkish
War of 1769–72 has been carefully investigated by
Hecker.<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c011'><sup>[75]</sup></a> The Turkish army, in consequence of inferior
nourishment, was badly infected with intermittent fever,
dysentery, and typhus fever when it set out from Constantinople
in March 1769. When the Russian troops advanced,
the Turks retreated after an engagement near Galatz. Since
the disease had been conveyed on ships from Constantinople
to Galatz, where many Russians succumbed to it, the city
was evacuated. On the way to Jassy every trace of the
pestilence disappeared, and in Jassy the soldiers were quartered
in the houses of the citizens. Since patients suffering
from contagious diseases had not been isolated in the military
hospitals there, in the middle of January typhus fever broke
out in them, accompanied by glandular swellings in the
groin. Four weeks later a Jew and his two children were
taken sick in the city and died, the Jew having bought
a fur coat in the hospital. Since the Russian commander-in-chief
did not hold the disease to be bubonic plague and did
nothing to prevent it from spreading, in March 1770 it spread
far and wide in Moldavia and Wallachia. Not until the end
of April was the presence of bubonic plague officially admitted;
and then the well-qualified physician Orraeus was commissioned
to make an investigation.</p>

<p class='c007'>From Jassy the disease was conveyed to Botoshany, which
also lies in northern Moldavia, and there it soon developed
into a severe epidemic and carried away more than 800 out
the town’s 2,500 inhabitants; the rest fled to Carpathia.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>‘The patients,’ says Hecker,<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c011'><sup>[76]</sup></a> ‘lay in tents, and without
care or medical help awaited an almost certain death. The
city itself afforded a sight of complete disorder; the houses
were deserted and stood with open windows and doors, the
air was poisoned with the odour of accumulated refuse,
and the general devastation bore silent witness to the most
extreme misery. In addition to that, there were multitudes
of savage, ravenous dogs, which dug up the dead and menaced
the sick.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Conditions were just as bad in Jassy when Orraeus arrived
there on May 10; of the inhabitants and of the Russian
garrison more than half had died, while many streets were
entirely depopulated. Since the persons infected with the
disease were placed out in a near-by forest, where they were
left without care, many patients were concealed inside the
houses and their bodies afterwards secretly buried in gardens
and cellars. There was no medical help, since both of the
Greek physicians had fled from the city. On May 20 the
Russian troops, at the instigation of Orraeus, withdrew from
Jassy; a convent was converted into a hospital, and soon
after that the pestilence began to subside. By June 22 it
had disappeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Wallachia the disease broke out somewhat later than
in Moldavia, and with considerably less severity. In Bucharest
it lasted until May.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Bender, situated in Bessarabia on the Dniester, there
was a mild epidemic of bubonic plague after the city had
been stormed on September 16, 1770. The carrying-off of
war-booty caused new pestilences in the army and in the
population of Podolia and Little Russia. For a short time
in the last part of September the main army also suffered
from plague in its fixed quarters on the Pruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Turkish army, which passed the winter in Bulgaria,
was severely attacked by plague, but no further information
about this outbreak is available.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>In February 1771, Moldavia and Wallachia suffered very
little from plague, although there were occasional outbreaks
here and there (for example, in Bucharest) until the year
1773; but these were always of short duration.</p>

<p class='c007'>The transplantation of this disease into neighbouring
countries, especially Russia and its capital, was of particular
importance. In consequence of the widespread occurrence
of bubonic plague in Moldavia and Wallachia when the war
broke out in the spring of 1770, large numbers of fugitives
from those parts gathered along the border of Transylvania,
where a quarantine establishment was opened at Törzburg
(south-west of Kronstadt). In Rukur, a border-village of
Wallachia, whither large numbers of people fled daily, a
Jewess succumbed at the end of April to bubonic plague,
and in the course of the next eight weeks 60 more people
died. From there the pestilence spread to neighbouring
localities, in which 615 out of 3,000 inhabitants (including
31 outsiders) died. The climax of the plague was in September.
It gradually spread throughout the border-towns
of Transylvania, but only in occasional instances did it
reach the interior of the country; all told, there were 1,024
deaths from the pestilence in Transylvania in the year
1770.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since all the supplies of the Russian army were conveyed
to it on Polish wagons, Polish peasants contracted the disease
in the infected countries, and then spread it throughout
Poland. Jewish pedlars, who purchased clothes, furs, and
war-booty in the Russian camp, likewise helped to spread
the disease. In Poland the plague became unusually widespread,
particularly in Podolia, Volhynia, and in the eastern
part of Galicia; 47 cities and 580 villages, according to
Chenot, were attacked, and 275 of the latter were almost
completely wiped out. The total loss in these regions is
estimated at 250,000. But the disease penetrated no further
into Poland, and Warsaw did not suffer at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>Southern Russia was attacked later than Poland—not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>until August 1770. Kiev was the first of several cities in
which the plague broke out; the disease, which was borne
there on infected wares from Podolia, carried away 20,000
people, about one-fifth of the population of the city. Fugitives
from Kiev conveyed the pestilence to many cities and
villages in Little Russia, while troops returning from Bender
helped to spread it in the north. In Nieskin, a city in
Ukraine, the plague caused horrible devastation; it broke
out there for the second time in the year 1771, and carried
away from 8,000 to 10,000 people.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was generally believed that the severe epidemic of
bubonic plague which raged in Moscow in the year 1771 was
directly connected with the expedition against the Turks.
At that time the city had some 230,000 inhabitants; the
streets, full of filth, were narrow, and the houses, most
of which were one-story wooden structures, stood close
together. According to Hecker, the beginning of the plague
is obscure; fugitives from the scene of the war, and wool
imported from Poland or Ukraine are both given as the
original means of dissemination, but inasmuch as the disease
was so widespread in the south, it is probable that it was
conveyed to the north in various ways. Schafonsky, writing
in Russian, described the plague in an excellent book, of
which Hecker made use; the description by a surgeon named
Samoilowitz,<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c011'><sup>[77]</sup></a> who did good service during the plague,
contracted the disease himself, and was roughly treated in
a revolt, according to Hecker, lacks scientific merit and is
unreliable. In November and December, 1770, there were
a few suspected cases in a hospital in the eastern part of
the city; Schafonsky diagnosed the disease as bubonic
plague, while the medical officer of the city called it typhus
fever. By means of strict isolation and other measures
this outbreak was soon entirely checked. As early as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>January and February, however, indubitable cases of plague
had occurred, but they were kept secret. The epidemic
really began in the Imperial cloth-manufactory, where 3,000
working-men were employed; not until 130 people had died
within eight weeks, was this fact made known on March 9,
1771. Since many of the working-men lived in the city and
had meanwhile conveyed the disease to their homes, the
measures of prevention came too late. The patients were
now taken to a convent in Ukresh (near Moscow), while all
the rest of the employees were quarantined. But these
measures merely helped to spread the disease, since many
of the working-men, in order to escape being quarantined,
fled and concealed themselves in the city. When it became
known that bubonic plague was present in Moscow, the
nobility fled to the country. The people themselves refused
to listen to any advice; nobody believed in contagion, and
in September there was actually a revolt in the city against
the measures that had been adopted to check the epidemic.
The compulsory confinement in hospitals of infected people
and the quarantining of their families led to numerous concealments.
In July the pestilence had already become very
widespread; many houses in the suburbs were empty, the
courts of justice and workshops were closed, and, since nurses
and grave-diggers were dying off rapidly, convicts were
employed to do their work. In the southern part of the city
a convent was converted into a hospital, and at the end of
July only one attendant was on hand there to take care of
1,000 patients. The epidemic reached its climax in September,
when from 600 to 1,000 persons died every day.
By January 1772, the pestilence had disappeared. From
the month of April 1771 on, the number of people that contracted
the disease and the number that died were officially
recorded; the number of deaths (excluding the bodies buried
in secret) was:</p>

<p class='c007'>The number of deaths, which at that time averaged 7,000
per annum in Moscow, thus increased to 58,000 (including
some 1,000 secret burials), and at least 52,000 were directly
due to the epidemic. About 150 priests were victims of
their calling.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the pestilence there was constant intercourse
between Moscow and the surrounding country, since the
necessaries of life had to be brought to the city, where clothes
and household goods were to be bought very cheaply. Thus
most of the villages and cities in the surrounding country
were infected. Some of the latter were almost completely
depopulated, while the estate-owners found protection by
shutting themselves up in their manors. Of the more distant
cities Jaroslav-on-the-Volga was very severely attacked,
while Borowsk, Kaluga, and Tula suffered somewhat less.
St. Petersburg was the only city to prohibit outsiders from
entering, and it was consequently spared.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V<br /> <span class='large'>THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND NAPOLEON’S RUSSIAN CAMPAIGN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The twenty years of fighting that followed the French
Revolution, and into which all Europe was drawn, were everywhere
accompanied by outbreaks of pestilence, many of which
were very serious. At the very beginning of the first Coalition
War (1792–7) they played an important rôle. A severe
epidemic of dysentery broke out among the Prussian troops
when they were advancing into Champagne, and this was
chiefly responsible for the failure of the invasion. Typhus
fever had also appeared and caused a great many deaths
among the Prussians, as well as among the inhabitants of
the Departments of Meuse, Moselle, Meurthe, and Ardennes.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c011'><sup>[78]</sup></a>
When the badly infected army of the Allies retreated, after
the engagement at Valmy (September 20, 1792), it left
behind its sick in various cities and villages, and thus
infected the French army that followed in pursuit. In
Longwy itself (which had remained in the power of the Allies
until October 22), and in the immediate vicinity, the streets
were filled with the bodies of soldiers who had succumbed,
partly to exhaustion, and partly to dysentery.<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c011'><sup>[79]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Verdun suffered terribly during the siege of the Allies, and
at the end of August was obliged to surrender. The chief
cause of the widespread occurrence of disease there was the
fearful lack of sanitation; ‘à Verdun,’ say Maréchal and
Didion<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c011'><sup>[80]</sup></a> ‘une des causes les plus puissantes d’infection était
le dépavement de la ville au moment du siège. Tous les
jours on jetait de chaque maison au milieu de la rue des
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>immondices de toute espèce, des déjections humaines et
animales, des débris, des végétaux, qui se mêlant à la boue
se liquéfiaient et se putréfiaient par l’action des pluies. Les
agents de la ferme des boues ne pouvaient rien contre tel
foyer. Il s’en échappait une odeur infecte, quand quelque
voiture venait à passer, et l’on voyait souvent des personnes
frappées de spasmes, prises de vomissements et même
asphyxiées en traversant les rues.’ (One of the most potent
causes of the infection at Verdun was the unpaved state of
the town at the time of the siege. Every day refuse of all
kinds was thrown from each house out into the street—the
evacuations of men and animals, rubbish, and garbage—and
there it mixed with the mud, liquefied and rotted through
the action of the rain. The officials in charge of street
sanitation were powerless. All this filth emitted a foul
odour when a carriage drove through it, and one often saw
people seized with convulsions and sickness, or even
suffocated while crossing the streets.) There was no more
thought of taking proper care of the sick and wounded
in Verdun at that time, than there was in the later French
wars; they lay in numbers on rotten straw, in their
own excrement, two or three of them sharing a single
blanket. The result was that two-thirds of the patients
died.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pont-à-Mousson, where three military hospitals were
erected, also had a severe epidemic, as did Metz; the
hospitals could not accommodate the many patients that
came streaming in from all directions. Typhus fever continued
to appear sporadically in the next two years; from
1792 to 1795 as many as 64,413 patients were received into
the Metz hospitals, and of that number 4,870 died.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the years 1793–4 typhus fever was frequently conveyed
into Germany in consequence of the warfare along the Upper
Rhine. In May 1793, it was brought to Frankfurt-on-the-Main
by French prisoners-of-war, whom the Austrians on
their march through the country had left behind. In addition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>to the cases of ‘putrid fever’ in the military hospitals, a few
cases were also observed in the city; until November the
disease raged extensively, but in the winter it increased in
fury and did not disappear until the summer of 1794. ‘The
descriptions of putrid fever,’ says L. Wilbrandt,<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c011'><sup>[81]</sup></a> ‘while
they make no mention of exanthema, nevertheless positively
prove that the disease was none other than exanthematic
typhus, war-typhus. The facts that the disease described
was highly infectious, and that it is expressly stated that
diarrhoea was not observed, lead us to this conclusion.’ In
the report of the health-officer, issued at the end of July
1793, it is nevertheless asserted that ‘the disease was of a
putrescent nature, involving spots and purpura’. The transportation
of French prisoners caused the epidemic to spread
to Günthersburg and from there to Bornheim, but only in
a mild form.</p>

<p class='c007'>A short article by Canz<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c011'><sup>[82]</sup></a> informs us about the spreading
of typhus fever from the Rhine to the Black Forest. The
disease was borne by French prisoners to Hornberg (near
Triberg), where in the autumn of 1793 they spent four weeks.
Owing to numerous outbreaks of ‘infectious nerve-fever’,
a war-hospital for such patients was established at Hornberg,
which had some 1,000 inhabitants. In November the first
patients appeared in the town, and the epidemic lasted until
the beginning of June of the following year; scarcely a single
house was spared, especially among the poor, and often
entire families contracted the disease. All told, sixty people
died, including eight outsiders who had been brought to the
hospital. According to Canz, infectious nerve-fever also
made its appearance in Kinzigtal, in the Rhine region, and
in several parts of Swabia. ‘In some cases,’ he says,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>‘petechiae appeared between the fifth and eighth days on
the breast, arms, and back; at first they were very small
and rose-red, but later they turned yellow, brown, and
finally blue and black, occasionally taking the form of large
blue blotches, like suggilations.’</p>

<p class='c007'>French prisoners also conveyed typhus fever to Bavaria.
According to Seitz,<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c011'><sup>[83]</sup></a> this was the case, for example in
Regensburg, where the disease raged furiously in December
1793. ‘There is no doubt,’ he says, ‘that the germ of this
disease was brought there by French captives, since many
contracted the disease and succumbed to it on the transport-ships
on which they were carried; and Schäffer (a physician
in Regensburg) also saw many people contract the fever
who had come in contact with them.’ Typhus fever was
disseminated all along the Danube—Donauwörth, Neuburg,
Ingolstadt, Vohburg, Kehlheim, Donaustauf, Pfatter, Straubing,
Deggendorf, and other places. Kulmbach was also
infected by the French soldiers.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the Coalition War violent conflicts took place in
western France in the Vendée, where the Royalist population
had risen against the new potentates. When Nantes was
besieged by the Royalists in 1793, a furious outbreak of
typhus fever occurred in that city.<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c011'><sup>[84]</sup></a> The prisons and
hospitals were greatly overcrowded, the city was filled with
dirt which nobody took the trouble to remove, and many
carcasses were left unburied. In the latter part of September
the disease broke out in the prison of Saintes-Claires, where
the prisoners were very closely packed together. According
to le Borgne, the official inspector said of this prison: ‘Tout
manquait dans cette maison—l’air, l’eau, les aliments, les
remèdes, tout jusqu’aux moyens d’ensevelir et d’enterrer les
morts.’ (Everything was lacking in the building—air, water,
food, remedies, and even the means for covering and burying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>the dead.) Without beds, without even straw, the prisoners
had to lie on the damp ground and be scantily fed on bad
bread and water. Regarding the Le Bouffay Prison, we read:
‘Des morts, des mourants, et des prisonniers nouvellement
infectés gisent sur le même grabat! Les cachots répandent
des miasmes putrides, et les lumières s’éteignent lorsqu’on
entre dans ces cloaques empestés!’ (Dead, dying, and recently
infected prisoners lie on the same pallet! The cells reek
with putrid miasma, and the lights go out when one enters
these pestilential sewers.) And regarding the L’Entrepôt
Prison we read: ‘La maladie était si intense à L’Entrepôt
que, de 22 sentinelles qui y montèrent la garde, 21 périrent
en très peu de jours, et que les membres du Conseil de
salubrité, qui eurent le triste courage d’y aller, en furent
presque tous les victimes.’ (The disease was so intense at
L’Entrepôt, that twenty-one out of twenty-two sentinels
who went on duty there died within a very few days, and
almost all the members of the Board of Health who had
the sad courage to go there fell victims to it.) The hospitals
were so crowded that three or four persons were obliged to
occupy the same bed. After December the disease also
spread to the city; of 300 grave-diggers employed by the
Revolutionary Committee, the majority were taken sick and
many died. The total number of deaths in the city and in
the prisons was estimated at 10,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Italy very severe pestilences spread in a very short time
over the entire peninsula, and even to Sicily, in consequence
of the war that had been going on there since 1796. These
pestilences were unusually severe in both camps during the
siege of Mantua (1796–7). (We shall learn more about this
in the tenth chapter.) In the year 1799 the French troops
under Scherer were forced to retreat in disorder before the
victorious advance of Suvarov and the Austrians, and they
took refuge in Nice. There, in the autumn of 1799, a severe
epidemic of typhus fever broke out in the French army and
soon spread to the non-belligerent population, one-third of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>which was carried away by it.<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c011'><sup>[85]</sup></a> In consequence of the removal
of the patients the disease was conveyed into southern
France, infecting Aix, Fréjus, Marseilles, Toulon, and even
Grenoble.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c011'><sup>[86]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The disease spread much more widely in the direction
of Italy, where it soon attacked the entire coast of Liguria.
A terrible epidemic of typhus fever occurred in Genoa in
1799–1800, when 14,000 people succumbed within six
months.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c011'><sup>[87]</sup></a> Rasori had noted the first cases as early as the
summer of 1799; the patients were fugitives from Upper
Italy, commercial travellers and military persons. Not until
the end of the winter and in the spring did the disease become
very widespread; it attacked principally the poorer people.
Rasori held the disease to be ‘nosocomial fever’ (typhus
fever), and his description of it makes this diagnosis seem
undoubtedly correct. Regarding the increased prevalence
of typhus fever during war-times, we are informed by the
following table of deaths, compiled by Ozanam:<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c011'><sup>[88]</sup></a></p>

wounded in Brünn, and carried away hundreds of French,
Russian, and Austrian soldiers. The pestilence soon spread

<p class='c007'>In Vienna, which on November 13, 1805, had been occupied
by the French, a severe epidemic of typhus fever soon broke
out in consequence of the overcrowded condition of the

caused the germ of typhus fever to be scattered along the

of duty, and the distribution of food brought many citizens
and servants in contact with them, and they were almost
all infected.’ Military hospitals were erected inside and
outside the city; and it is stated that those who were
directly infected by the Russians suffered much more
severely than those who contracted the disease later on.
Diarrhoea was rare, but on the skin appeared ‘red spots
of varying size and shape, usually like flea-bites; they
developed first on the neck and breast.’ The climax of the
epidemic was in the last part of January and the first part
of February; in May it disappeared. Of 183 patients
treated, Roller lost 26 by death. The total number of deaths
in Pforzheim due to the pestilence was 130 (civilians), 77 of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>them being between the ages of twenty and sixty. The total
number of deaths, which in the years 1801–5 had averaged
163, in the year 1806 was 346; in the years 1807–10 the
average number of deaths was 196.</p>

<p class='c007'>Typhus fever also appeared in France in the winter of
1805–6, having been brought there by prisoners of war;
Autun, Semur, and Langres were attacked.<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c011'><sup>[95]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In Napoleon’s war against Prussia (1806–7) typhus fever
broke out in the provinces of East Prussia, where the second
half of the war was waged. According to Hufeland,<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c011'><sup>[96]</sup></a> the
disease appeared wherever the soldiers went in the fall,
winter, and following spring; he diagnosed it as putrid
fever, nerve fever, and typhus fever. Hufeland, to be sure,
often points to the fact that the disease of 1806–7 was in
several respects different from that of 1803; in particular,
the disease of 1806–7 was characterized by a long period of
incubation, lasting diarrhoea, meteorism, blood in the evacuations
of the bowels, and a long convalescence. But since
Hufeland expressly says that the disease lasted twenty-one
days, and at the same time mentions petechiae and the fact
that the disease often broke out suddenly, there can be no
doubt that it was typhus fever. The peculiar mixed character
of his description can be explained only by the assumption
that epidemics of typhus fever and typhoid fever
appeared simultaneously, and that the two diseases were
regarded as one and the same. Gilbert<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c011'><sup>[97]</sup></a> expressly mentions
‘éruptions pétéchiales’ in his description of these epidemics
in the military hospitals. In Königsberg typhus fever raged
in the hospitals and among the inhabitants, 6,392 of whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>died. In Thorn, Bromberg, and Culm, all of which had
military lazarets, the disease spread from them to the civil
population. In Danzig, which in the spring of 1807 passed
through a siege of seventy-six days, the condition of health
was good, whereas typhus fever raged among the French
besiegers. In 1805–6 the disease was conveyed by Russian
troops to Silesia, where it broke out in Trachenberg, Adelnau,
Ostrowo, Wohlau, Neisse, and Leobschütz.<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c011'><sup>[98]</sup></a> German
prisoners brought typhus fever with them to France, where
it broke out in the first part of January 1807, in the Departments
of Aube and Yonne.<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c011'><sup>[99]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Typhus fever raged less furiously during Napoleon’s war
with Austria in 1809. After the battle of Wagram it
appeared in the overcrowded hospitals of Vienna, and also
in Tyrol. Since the war had first been waged in Bavaria, the
disease had also broken out there (in Landshut and Augsburg),
but had nowhere become very widespread.</p>

<p class='c007'>Typhus fever broke out in the form of very severe epidemics
during the long struggle of the French in Spain and
Portugal in the years 1808–14, since here the French army
suffered terribly in consequence of unremitting hardships,
the scanty supply of food, and the poor hospital arrangements.
While in the Spanish Peninsula the French army
is said to have lost 300,000 men in consequence of disease,
and 100,000 men in consequence of the enemy’s arms. A
particularly severe epidemic raged in Saragossa when that
city was besieged by the French in the months of June,
July, and August 1808, and again in the months of December-February,
1808 and 1809; of 100,000 inhabitants 54,000
succumbed to typhus fever, and of 30,000 soldiers 18,000
fell victims to the same disease, so that the city was forced
to capitulate.<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c011'><sup>[100]</sup></a> In the year 1810 yellow fever caused great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>devastation in the southern part of Spain, attacking Cadiz,
Cartagena, and Gibraltar; in 1811 it raged furiously in the
provinces of Murcia and Valencia,<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c011'><sup>[101]</sup></a> but the epidemic was
confined to the coast.</p>

<p class='c007'>From Spain typhus fever was frequently conveyed by
transports of prisoners to France; the border districts
through which the prisoners passed were the first to be
attacked, as, for instance, the town of Dax (near Bayonne).
Ozanam says:<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c011'><sup>[102]</sup></a> ‘La France en ressentit les effets depuis
les Pyrénées jusqu’aux environs de Paris, sur toutes les
routes suivies par les prisonniers espagnols, et l’Angleterre
en fut infestée au retour des débris de ses troupes du même
pays. En France la ville de Dax, frontière de l’Espagne,
fut une des premières à éprouver les ravages des maladies
épidémiques, qui accompagnent toujours les armées. La
situation basse et marécageuse, jointe à l’encombrement de
son hôpital par des militaires atteints du typhus nosocomial,
ne tarda pas à favoriser la propagation de la contagion, et
elle fut bientôt transmise aux environs. Les prisonniers
espagnols y contribuèrent encore, et le caractère contagieux
de la maladie ne fut pas plus douteux, lorsqu’on vit les
employés au service des hôpitaux et à celui du transport
de ces militaires en être tous atteints.’ (France felt the
effects (of the disease) all along the routes followed by the
Spanish prisoners—from the Pyrenees to the environs of
Paris, while England was infected by the remnants of its
troops when they returned from France. The town of Dax,
situated near the border between France and Spain, was
one of the first places to experience the ravages of the
epidemic diseases which always accompanied the armies.
Its low, marshy situation, together with the fact that its
hospital was overcrowded with soldiers infected with nosocomial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>typhus, greatly favoured the propagation of the
contagion, which soon spread throughout the vicinity. The
Spanish prisoners also helped to spread it, and the contagious
character of the disease was no longer questionable when the
attendants at the hospitals, as well as the men who had
charge of transporting the sick, were seen to contract it.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The Spanish prisoners were sent far into the interior, and
caused outbreaks of pestilence wherever they went. In
consequence of the strain and exertion involved in their
transportation, and also of the inferior food, typhus fever
soon became very widespread among them. Diseased and
wounded men were always carried in the same wagons,
while it was often necessary to remain for a considerable
length of time in camps, where sick and healthy men lay
side by side on straw; thus many died on the way. In
order to prevent the disease from spreading to the civil
population, it was arranged that the buildings designated
for the prisoners should lie away from the town where the
soldiers were quartered, or that the prisoners should be
sheltered in barracks. All intercourse between the prisoners
and the inhabitants was forbidden, and after their departure
the straw used by them was burned, and the buildings
they had occupied were fumigated.<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c011'><sup>[103]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Since, however, it finally became necessary to house the
sick in hospitals, it was absolutely impossible to prevent
the disease from spreading. The result was that the following
places in Central France were attacked: Limoges,
Guéret, Châteauroux, Issoudun, Moulins, Nevers, La Charité,
and Bourges.<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c011'><sup>[104]</sup></a> As people everywhere were afraid of contracting
the disease, the prisoners were transferred as
soon as possible to near-by districts, and this merely helped
to spread the disease. According to Boin, Bourges, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>year 1809, became the rendezvous of all Spanish prisoners,
who were housed there in barracks and in public hospitals;
of 653 prisoners of war received in the public hospitals, 103
died. In the city itself only a few cases of typhus fever
were observed. The highly contagious nature of the disease
was well known to Boin, who says:</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Les dames religieuses de la Charité, chargées du service
des salles, les élèves en chirurgie, les servans, les gardes de
nuit, le casernier, les gendarmes qui escortaient les voitures
remplies de prisonniers malades, le chapelain, le secrétaire
du commissaire des guerres, les personnes que la charité
évangélique a fait imprudemment entrer dans les salles, ont
été frappés de la maladie. Tous ont couru des risques, quelques-uns
ont succombé.’ (The nuns who had charge of the
rooms (in the hospital) at La Charité, the medical students,
the attendants, the night-watchmen, the porter, the gendarmes
who escorted the carriages conveying sick prisoners, the
chaplain, the secretary of the War Commissioner, and the
persons who imprudently allowed a sense of duty and charity
to induce them to enter the rooms—all contracted the disease.
They all ran risks, and some of them died.) Nevertheless,
Boin did not hold the disease in Bourges to be typhus fever,
but a ‘fièvre maligne putride’; he also adds that he failed
to observe petechiae in a single instance. The physicians sent
by the Government, on the other hand, diagnosed the disease
as ‘hospital fever’. Inasmuch as there is no doubt expressed
anywhere else regarding the appearance of typhus fever
among the Spanish prisoners (Ozanam speaks expressly of
the appearance of petechiae on the second, third, or fourth
day), it was undoubtedly that disease which broke out in
Bourges.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not only the French, but also the English troops were
attacked by typhus fever in Spain and Portugal; they are
said to have lost 24,930 men in consequence of diseases, and
8,889 men in consequence of battles and skirmishes. The
disease was conveyed to England by returning soldiers, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>was confined there to a few houses. After the battles of
the year 1808, which went against the English, the badly
infected English troops were transported on ships in stormy
weather to Plymouth, where from January 24, 1808, to
January 24, 1809, some 2,427 of them were received into
the hospitals. Of that number 824 were suffering from
typhus fever, and 1,503 from dysentery; all told, 405 died.<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c011'><sup>[105]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <span class='large'>THE EPIDEMICS OF TYPHUS FEVER IN CENTRAL EUROPE FOLLOWING UPON THE RUSSIAN CAMPAIGN AND DURING THE WARS OF LIBERATION (1812–14)</span></h2>
</div>
<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c012'>1. <span class='sc'>General Observations regarding Typhus Fever</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>Typhus fever, as a specific disease, was well known to
the military physicians during the age of Napoleon, since,
as set forth in the previous chapter, it regularly appeared
during the numerous Napoleonic wars in the form of widespread
epidemics. In France the simple word ‘typhus’
was often used to denote the disease, and the custom still
prevails there. In Germany the disease was called infectious
nerve fever, war plague, lazaret fever, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the beginning of the nineteenth century it was
generally believed that great hardships, colds, lack of the
necessaries of life, and the consequent consumption of spoiled
foodstuffs give rise to fevers, and that these fevers, in accordance
with the epidemic character of the year and of the
season, and also in accordance with the severity of the hardships
undergone, might develop into dysentery and typhus
fever. At all events, even the eminent physicians of the
day, men like Hildenbrand of Vienna<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c011'><sup>[106]</sup></a> and Hufeland of
Berlin, who in the course of two decades had abundant
opportunity to study the disease, assumed that it is possible
for typhus fever to break out spontaneously. It was
believed that this fever, originating spontaneously, gradually
developed the power of infection. Hufeland’s position
was self-contradictory, for he assumes that the disease can
break out spontaneously and yet that it can be warded off
by means of isolation.<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c011'><sup>[107]</sup></a> He says: ‘A proof of the fact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>that this disease can spread only through infection is offered
by the stronghold of Küstrin, which, being closed up tightly
during the entire year of 1813, was free from disease, whereas
all the surrounding country, even the army of the besiegers,
suffered terribly.’ Whereupon Hufeland immediately adds:
‘The war carried on among us and by us with such unheard-of
exertion and hardship caused the disease to break out several
times anew throughout our country, and hence it could but
become general.’ That it is possible for typhus fever to
break out spontaneously and subsequently spread by infection
was everywhere believed, even by French physicians.
It is hardly necessary to say, however, that the theory of
the spontaneous origination of the disease does not accord
with modern views. The severe hardships undergone, the
hunger and cold, the effluvium of gangrenous wounds, the
moral depression, and the many other bad effects which
characterized this war more than any other, necessarily
decreased the soldiers’ power of resistance and increased
their susceptibility to infection. Incidentally, all sorts of
telluric and meteorological phenomena, volcanic eruptions,
earthquakes, the great heat and dryness of the year 1811,
the meteors of that year—all these things were at the time
brought into causal connexion with the war pestilences of
the years 1813–14.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Many people stated positively’, says Hufeland,<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c011'><sup>[108]</sup></a> ‘that
they contracted the disease almost immediately after they
had occupied small, narrow rooms in company with infected
French soldiers, or after they had washed their clothes or
waited upon them. This frequently happened in small
houses that undertook, for a small profit, to shelter invalid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>soldiers quartered upon the wealthier citizens. Many asserted
that they contracted the disease by passing the night in
small inns in the towns and villages around Berlin, and on
the roads from Königsberg, Danzig, and Frankfurt, and by
sleeping on beds or straw which had shortly before been
used by infected Frenchmen or Russians. A certain number
of men contracted typhus fever by serving as attendants,
in order to earn a little money, in the local French
military hospital. In this way many of the servants and
attendants employed there, as well as numerous surgeons
and apothecaries, contracted the disease and subsequently
infected the members of their families who brought them
home and took care of them, and who, in turn, infected the
other inhabitants of the house and of the neighbouring
houses.’ Further on, Hufeland adds that only those inmates
of the hospital contracted the disease who, as servants and
attendants, had been in close and constant contact with
the patients.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the years 1813–14 a large number of physicians were
carried away by typhus fever; it was estimated at that
time that some 500 of them throughout Germany (excluding
the surgeons) fell victims to the disease—in Silesia alone
63 physicians died, in Leipzig 17, in Württemberg 17, and
in Baden 35.<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c011'><sup>[109]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Emphasis was always laid upon the fact that the clothes
and other effects of people who had succumbed to typhus
fever were highly infectious. The wide prevalence of the
disease among the Jewish inhabitants of Vilna was attributed
to ignorance or disregard of this fact; for when orders
were issued to destroy such clothing, the Jews, out of sheer
avarice, disobeyed them. The persons who acquired such
effects in this cheap and illicit manner usually paid the
penalty themselves; in addition, they did a great deal
toward spreading the disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>The military hospitals were also largely responsible for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>the dissemination of typhus fever; Parenteau-Desgranges<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c011'><sup>[110]</sup></a>
called them outright ‘centres de contagion’. The cities in
which military hospitals were erected were always severely
attacked by the disease. It was generally complained, even
by the French physicians, that the French hospitals were
poorly arranged and badly managed—even simple cleanliness
and competent attendants were lacking. Patients
suffering from infectious disease were placed together with
others suffering from some mild form of sickness or from
a wound, thus giving the infection the best conceivable
chance to spread. Let us read how a French physician
describes the conditions in Verdun during the severe
epidemic of typhus fever that raged there in the years
1792–5:<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c011'><sup>[111]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>‘The disease spread with no less severity from other
sources of infection, such as the temporary hospitals established
in the Convent of Canons of Saint Nicholas, in the
Monastery of Saint Vannes, and in the barracks. The unfortunate
patients, thrown in heaps on the damp stone and
earth floors, scarcely having under them a few mats, or
perhaps some dirty straw, filthy with their excrement, three
of them often sharing a single blanket of coarse wool, presented
the most dismal picture one could possibly imagine.
At least three-quarters of the patients died. They were
buried in huge ditches dug in the vicinity of the ramparts,
and in the gardens surrounding the abbeys of Saint Vannes
and of Saint Nicholas.’</p>

<p class='c007'>The German Central Hospital Management, which was
founded in the latter part of November 1813, and from
which Bavaria and Württemberg held aloof, sought to introduce
certain improvements into the military lazaret system,
but it was unable to accomplish a great deal, owing to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>lack of hospitals, physicians, and all the means necessary for
the treatment of sick and injured people.</p>

<p class='c007'>Very dangerous for the dissemination of the disease was
the belief that the placing of typhus fever patients together
with other invalids did no harm, but rather that the congregating
of numerous typhus fever patients by themselves
caused the contagion to develop with especial severity.
The Saxon staff surgeon Neumann, for example, writes in
regard to this question:<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c011'><sup>[112]</sup></a> ‘Anybody who lies in a bed to
which the poison is still clinging will without fail contract
the disease; on the other hand, I have often seen people
suffering from other forms of sickness lie alongside of typhus-fever
patients and escape infection, provided they had nothing
in common, did not touch one another, or make use of one
another’s linen. Hence I draw the conclusion that the
poison of typhus fever, like the poison of bubonic plague
and small-pox, cannot enter the system from a distance,
not even from a very short distance, and can be communicated
only by close and direct contact. This seems to
contradict our experience that the intensity of the poison is
greatly increased when several patients lie side by side.
Accordingly, I warn all military physicians not to congregate
all their typhus fever patients in a single room by themselves;
for few would come forth from such a room alive,
while the poisoned atmosphere of the room would pervade
the entire lazaret, infect the physicians and attendants, and
finally spread throughout the immediate neighbourhood.
People think that they can prevent the disease from spreading
by congregating and isolating the patients, but as a
matter of fact this has the opposite effect. This is clear
when we consider that the mere being together of unhealthy
people causes the poison to develop, and that not only the
people themselves, but also the very exhalations from their
bodies, are sufficient to spread the infection. For example,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>if a considerable quantity of dirty clothes or linen is allowed
to accumulate in a pile, and after a short time is picked up,
the usual result is that the people who do the work experience
a severe attack of typhus fever.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Very often conditions made segregation impossible, even
when it was desired, or else the French generals refused to
permit it. Consequently, infection was so frequent in the
hospitals that the disease at a very early date acquired the
name ‘hôpital fever’ (fièvre d’hôpital).</p>

<p class='c007'>The fact that the weather conditions exerted some influence
was not to be overlooked; in the year 1813, when the
warm weather began, the disease abated a little, whereas
in the year 1814 it ceased altogether at the beginning of the
warm weather. The reason for this was that the cold
weather forced people to huddle together in houses, and
that bathing and washing, particularly among the soldiers
and poor people, was less frequently and profusely indulged
in; another reason was that the heavier clothing worn in
winter facilitated the breeding of vermin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Failure to take measures of precaution, if the disease
once broke out in a neighbouring place, also contributed
greatly toward the dissemination of it. ‘If typhus fever
was present in any military halting-place, frequently nothing
was done to prevent it from infecting the next place, where
it had not yet made its appearance; or, if anything was
done, it was often merely to issue an order which was not
complied with.’<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c011'><sup>[113]</sup></a> At the same time, to be sure, one must
take into account the fact that sheer ignorance rendered
useful measures impossible. If this ignorance prevailed in
the highest places, nothing better was to be expected of the
small cities and towns.</p>

<p class='c007'>That the ‘contagious typhus’ prevalent during the Napoleonic
wars was the same disease which we call typhus fever
is very certain. The physicians of the middle of the nineteenth
century, when views of typhus and typhoid fever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>had cleared up somewhat, have confirmed this fact.<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c011'><sup>[114]</sup></a> The
descriptions of the disease are almost invariably reproductions
of the same picture, the sole difference being that it
was much more severe and fatal among the half-starved
soldiers on their return from Russia, and among soldiers
packed together in strongholds, than it was among people
who were less afflicted by the war and who lived at a distance
from the military routes.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a rule, the disease broke out eight or nine days after
infection. It began with a general indisposition, which
lasted several days, or, if this indisposition failed to appear,
with a chill, great languor, loss of appetite, and weakness in
the limbs; frequently brain disorders also manifested themselves,
at first in the form of a mild stupefaction, singing in
the ears, violent headache, somnolence, or wild delirium.
The exanthema usually appeared between the fourth and
the seventh day. Hufeland describes it as ‘an outbreak of
red spots, covering most of the body; they were mostly
of a violet tinge, but were not sharply defined, and often
gradually merged into the colour of the rest of the skin’.
It was frequently asserted that the petechiae now and then
failed to appear at all, even in severe cases. Jörg says
expressly:<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c011'><sup>[115]</sup></a> ‘Sometimes they broke out sparsely, one here
and one there, and in such cases it was easy to overlook
them.’ After the disease had progressed for two or three
weeks the patient’s temperature went down, and there were
few fatalities after the twenty-first day. Convalescence
was of short duration, provided the outbreak had not been
preceded by exhaustion due to hardships. In regard to
abdominal and intestinal symptoms, great dissimilarity was
observed; Hufeland states that when there were no complications,
an autopsy revealed not the slightest change in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>the intestinal organs, and Horn says that ‘the colour of
the intestines was often almost natural.’ The severity
of the disease varied greatly; it was particularly fatal
among the soldiers homeward-bound from Russia, more than
half of whom died. It is frequently asserted that the
majority of those who were thus directly infected succumbed
to the disease, and that it carried away some ten per cent
of the civil inhabitants who contracted it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course it would be a mistake to say that all the epidemics
of that time were epidemics of typhus fever; undoubtedly
typhoid fever carried away large numbers of people, since
it is to be assumed that the disease was endemic in many
cities. But owing to the inaccuracy of the descriptions and
the lack of autopsies, it is usually impossible to distinguish
the diseases with certainty. Even when the results of
autopsies were made known, the condition of the intestines
was often described so inaccurately that we cannot even
make out whether or not there were intestinal ulcers, which
are the most important pathological-anatomical symptoms of
typhoid fever. But the initial chill, the short duration of
the disease (three weeks), the presence of petechiae, the rapid
fall of temperature, and the shorter convalescence, all of
which are ever-recurring symptoms, enable us to distinguish
the epidemic of the years 1812–14 with certainty from typhoid
fever.</p>

<p class='c007'>Through the influence of the works of Hildenbrand and
Hufeland the larger part of the medical world of that time
came to look upon contagious typhus as a specific disease;
other views, however, were vigorously supported, for example,
by Markus of Bamberg, who held it to be an inflammation
of the brain. The difference of opinion regarding the character
of the disease was important, not only theoretically, but also
practically, in view of the therapeutic practice of the time;
for those who regarded the disease as an inflammation of
the brain had naturally, in accordance with the methods
then in vogue, to resort to bleeding. But all unprejudiced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>observers came to the conclusion that bleeding was harmful,
and that it killed all the patients upon whom it was frequently
practised. Very soon the beneficial influence of fresh air
and cold came to be recognized, and the latter was often
provided by means of cold-water baths and douches. ‘It
was a universally confirmed principle, derived from experience,
that the warmer the patients were kept, the more severe
was the disease, and the colder they were kept, the milder
the disease.’ How beneficial fresh air was for the patients
was shown by the fact that those who were kept out in the
open air withstood the disease much more easily than those
who were kept shut up in houses and hospitals, and that it
was much less dangerous to transport patients from place
to place in the open air, than to keep them shut up in overcrowded
hospitals. ‘Thousands of patients’, says H. Häser,<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c011'><sup>[116]</sup></a>
‘survived even the most severe forms of the disease without
human help of any kind. Many, especially physicians,
attributed their recovery to the fact that for weeks at a time
they were constantly being transported in the cold winter
from one halting-place to another, and were not compelled
to lie in overcrowded hospitals, where typhus fever and
dysentery raged most terribly.’</p>

<p class='c007'>In dealing with the epidemic of typhus fever of the years
1812–14 we have a double epidemic to consider. The one
was disseminated directly by the returning remnants of the
‘Grand Army’, and after causing terrible devastation in
East Prussia it spread, in a relatively milder form, to other
parts of Germany. The other epidemic broke out during
the great battles in Saxony, which lasted several months,
and from there spread virulently over a large part of Germany.
In order to avoid repetition, the following account will
treat of the dissemination of the two epidemics jointly.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>2. <span class='sc'>The Russian Campaign and Typhus Fever in Russia</span><a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c011'><sup>[117]</sup></a></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Napoleon began to make preparations for his Russian
campaign as early as the year 1811; troops were assembled
in Westphalia, Hamburg, Saxony, Holland, on the Rhine,
and near Verona, and several hospitals were founded, as in
Danzig. An army of 550,000 men was organized to take
part in the expedition into Russia; it consisted of Frenchmen,
Germans, Italians, Spaniards, and Poles. How this
army was destroyed on its march to and from Moscow, and
in what a pitiable condition the remnants of it arrived in
Germany, is well known. Since it is our purpose to point out
here how that severe epidemic of typhus fever spread abroad
from those remnants, we can deal but briefly with the
prevalence of the disease in the army itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>In consequence of the great heat, of the lack of drinking-water
and good food, and of the continual bivouacking (the
peasants burned and deserted all the villages along the way),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>the army suffered greatly even on the march to Moscow.
After crossing the Polish border the soldiers were severely
attacked by dysentery and diarrhoea; Kerckhoffs estimates
that no less than 80,000 men were suffering from dysentery
at the beginning of August 1812. Typhus fever broke out,
very sparsely, to be sure, as early as the latter part of July,
when the army arrived at Vilna; there were also cases in
the hospitals at Minsk, Vilkomir, Globokie, and Mittau, but
the disease was not yet so infectious as it proved to be later.
After the battle of Smolensk (August 14–18) large numbers
of wounded soldiers (between 6,000 and 10,000 according
to various reports) were brought to that city, and from that
time on, typhus fever and other diseases (hospital fever,
diarrhoea, dysentery, gastric fever, &amp;c.) continued to spread
throughout the army. On September 14, Moscow was
entered, and on September 15 the city was in flames. The
army then had peace until October 19, when the return
march began. During their sojourn in Moscow the soldiers
were very improperly nourished, eating almost nothing but
salted meat and fish, and drinking large quantities of wine
and spirits. According to Lemazurier, the number of sick
and wounded soldiers in Moscow was 15,000. The most
common disease even in Moscow was typhus fever; according
to Scheerer, when Napoleon’s army withdrew from the city
it left behind several thousand typhus-fever patients, almost
all of whom died—only the stronger patients were taken
along on wagons.</p>

<p class='c007'>The horrors of the return march are well known. Thousands
froze to death in the extreme cold of November, horse-meat
and melted snow were the sole means of nourishment, and
any soldier who lay down was irretrievably lost. Between
Moscow and Smolensk, which was reached on November 9,
one-half of the soldiers who had started out from Moscow
died; the number of sick soldiers was enormous, and typhus
fever raged more and more extensively. On December 8
Vilna was reached, but there the army was not given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>a moment’s rest; two days later the Russians advanced
and captured 30,000 of Napoleon’s soldiers who could go
no further.</p>

<p class='c007'>In pursuing the French army the Russians also suffered
severely from diseases; according to Ebstein,<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c011'><sup>[118]</sup></a> between
October 20 and December 14, 1812, they lost 61,964 men,
most of whom died of ‘nerve fever’ (typhus fever).</p>

<p class='c007'>In Vilna, which was greatly overcrowded, typhus fever
raged furiously. The large number of sick and exhausted
soldiers that were left behind, owing to the extreme cold
(the thermometer went down as low as –28° Réaumur) sought
shelter, partly in private houses, and partly in hospitals.
The latter, for the first few days after the arrival of the
Russians, were in a terrible condition; sick men and dead
men were packed together in the cold, unheated rooms,
the former lying on rotten straw, completely deserted,
and without care or nourishment. The corridors and courts
were filled with dead bodies and with refuse of all kinds,
while in the rooms themselves there was no less filth, since
nobody removed the excrements. ‘The courts and corridors
of the hospitals’, says Gasc, an eye-witness,<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c011'><sup>[119]</sup></a> ‘were so covered
with dead bodies that it was necessary to walk over heaps
of them in order to enter the rooms.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Not until after the Emperor of Russia arrived in Vilna
was some semblance of order restored. But it was then
too late; almost all the patients in the hospitals were
infected with typhus fever, and according to Gasc and
Lemazurier the great majority of the 30,000 French prisoners
died. For owing to the long series of extreme hardships
which the soldiers had undergone, the disease broke out in
its most severe form, causing wild delirium, very large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>petechiae, abscesses, and gangrene. Many patients succumbed
within twenty-four hours, and recovery was very slow for
those who survived the attack.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a short time the disease spread throughout the city,
not so much because the soldiers were quartered in private
houses, as because the Jews got possession of the clothes of
the dead. Of some 30,000 Jewish inhabitants no less than
8,000 died. In February and March all classes of society,
even the wealthiest people, were attacked. The disease also
spread to the surrounding country; Lemazurier says that
between the middle of 1812 and the beginning of 1813 some
55,000 bodies were buried in Vilna and vicinity, and that
the estimates made in Wittepsk, Smolensk, and Moscow were
in proportion. The pestilence spread southward and eastward,
and according to Faure, in February 1813 thousands
of French prisoners died in the overcrowded hospitals in
Orel. The same writer says that all of the French soldiers
who fell into the hands of the Russians succumbed to typhus
fever.<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c011'><sup>[120]</sup></a> We may safely assume that the civil inhabitants
of all places in that part of the country were also attacked,
even though we have no figures or statistics to confirm the
assumption.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pestilence also raged extensively in the region of the
Baltic Sea; St. Petersburg was severely attacked by it.
According to Parrot,<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c011'><sup>[121]</sup></a> in the last months of the year 1812
there were a great many cases of ‘nerve fever’ in Dorpat;
in Riga the military hospitals were overcrowded, and out
of a population of 36,000 and a garrison of 20,000 there were
5,000 sick. The mortality in the hospitals was very high,
since, on account of the extreme cold, two-thirds of the
small windows were covered with boards and hay.</p>

<p class='c007'>Regarding conditions in Warsaw we have more detailed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>information. According to Wolf,<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c011'><sup>[122]</sup></a> two distinct epidemics
raged there after the end of December 1812; the one was
an epidemic of typhus fever (probably typhoid) and appeared
only among the soldiers; the other was an epidemic of
typhus fever, which did not attain to epidemic dimensions
until January 1813, although a few isolated cases had been
observed in Warsaw in the last months of the year 1812.
‘This disease was almost invariably accompanied by a spotted
exanthema, which, if the disease was at first rather difficult
to diagnose, often gave the first clue. In the case of many
people the eruption was so severe and so general, appearing
even on the face, that it resembled measles.’ The comparison
with measles was also drawn by other observers. Typhus
fever was conveyed to Warsaw by the Austrian auxiliary
corps, and it quickly spread to the French hospitals, which
were in a wretched condition. Later the Russian army also
brought typhus fever to the city. A great many civilians
in Warsaw contracted the disease; according to Wolf, the
epidemic reached its climax in February, and lasted until
the end of the year 1813. The lower classes suffered more
than the upper classes from the disease, which, moreover,
seems to have raged much more furiously in the vicinity
of Warsaw than in the city itself.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c012'>3. <span class='sc'>The Appearance of Typhus Fever in North and Central Germany</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>On the return march from Moscow to Vilna the remnants
of the army had all taken the same route; for, though all
bonds of discipline were loosened as far back as Smolensk,
nevertheless the instinct of self-preservation kept all the
soldiers from abandoning the common line of march. This
was also the case during the march from Vilna to the Niemen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>where the extreme cold caused untold suffering. After
crossing the river, however, the few unfortunate soldiers
who had survived the awful misery of the march, hungry,
clothed in rags, with torn shoes, alive with vermin, with
frozen and gangrenous limbs, scattered in all directions,
some going home, and others to strongholds that were in
the hands of the French. Thus typhus fever, with which
all parts of the army were infected, was spread in a comparatively
short time over a large part of Germany.</p>

<p class='c007'>At first the eastern provinces of Prussia, through which
these remnants of the army passed, were attacked by the
pestilence; owing to the fact that so many were infected,
measures of precaution were everywhere futile. ‘Adynamic
fever’, says Kerckhoffs,<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c011'><sup>[123]</sup></a> ‘spread also among the civilians,
who were not only afflicted by the terrible scourge of our
passing armies, but also became the victims of a murderous
contagion. It was a fatal present which we gave them, and
which caused such a high mortality among the inhabitants
of the country through which we passed. Wherever we went,
the inhabitants were filled with terror and refused to quarter
the soldiers.’ In the more distant parts of Germany, in
the western provinces of Prussia, in Bavaria, Baden, and
Württemberg, where people had perceived the danger, it
was easier, in the first months of 1813, to guard against the
dissemination of typhus fever, since the number of returning
soldiers was small and it was accordingly feasible to enforce
orders regarding quarantine. With the approach of spring
the disease began to abate a little even in the north and east;
in the month of April it had almost entirely disappeared
from the French troops there, while in May and June the
condition of health among them, according to Kerckhoffs,
was very good. But in July typhus fever broke out again,
and since the Russian army was also infected with it, the
disease became uncommonly widespread throughout Saxony
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>and Silesia during the months of fighting that ensued.
After the battle of Leipzig, when southern and western
Germany were overrun by French fugitives and prisoners,
typhus fever once more broke out in that part of the
country with greater severity than ever before; even in
the province of Brandenburg and in the adjacent regions
the pestilence raged, having been borne thither by French
prisoners.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Lithuania, and East and West Prussia, typhus fever
raged extensively in the winter of 1812–13. According to
H. A. Göden,<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c011'><sup>[124]</sup></a> who had charge of a large military lazaret
in Gumbinnen, the epidemic spread continuously from the
border of Russia to Berlin. ‘It appeared most virulently’,
he says, ‘in the cities of Gumbinnen, Insterburg, Tilsit,
Königsberg, Elbing, Marienwerder, Konitz, and Landsberg;
it followed along the military roads, and broke out most
severely in the halting-places and in those cities where
French military lazarets were established.’ In Gumbinnen
typhus fever broke out suddenly in the latter part of November,
immediately after the arrival of the fugitives, and spread
rapidly. At first it appeared in houses where officers and
soldiers were quartered; as a rule, several members of a
family contracted the disease simultaneously, and only rarely
was one member spared. The pestilence raged most furiously
in the months of January and February; the town had
some 6,000 inhabitants, and frequently 20, 30, or 40 people,
including entire families, died in a single day. In the military
lazarets the mortality was considerably higher. In March
the pestilence began to abate, and in May it disappeared
altogether.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Königsberg the pestilence began in the month of December
1812 and came to an end in May 1813; excluding the
soldiers who died in the military lazarets, the following
deaths were recorded there:</p>

<p class='c007'>In the year 1812 there were 2,648 deaths in Königsberg,
whereas in the following year there were 4,403. In the first
part of January, when the city was evacuated by the French,
10,000 people, according to Stricker, were left behind. The
entire province of East Prussia, according to Gurlt, lost
20,000 inhabitants by typhus fever.<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c011'><sup>[125]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Danzig, which was besieged by the Russians from January 11
to November 29, 1813, suffered terribly. A French army of
35,900 men, under General Rapp, was in the city, and during
the siege it was exposed to all sorts of privations as well as to
extreme cold. As early as February typhus fever had become
very widespread; from January to May, 11,400 soldiers died
in the hospitals (4,000 in March alone), while 5,592 inhabitants
succumbed to the disease in the course of the entire year.<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c011'><sup>[126]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Silesia was hit extremely hard. The pestilence was
conveyed there in the months of October, November, and
December 1812 by transports of Russian prisoners, and it
appeared in Trebnitz, Striegau, Krottkau, Friedenwalde,
Trachenberg, Breslau, Parchwitz, Quaritz, &amp;c. The officers
on duty, the persons who lifted the patients from the wagons,
the physicians, and the sick-attendants were always the
first to be infected.<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c011'><sup>[127]</sup></a> With the opening of spring the disease
disappeared, but broke out anew after the battle on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Katzbach. In Breslau the disease appeared in a very
virulent form, since the infected soldiers were housed there
in overcrowded lazarets, which in the month of November
took in some 6,300 patients daily; numerous physicians
(statements vary between 16 and 22) also succumbed
to typhus fever. Among the civil inhabitants, to be
sure, the disease did not become very widespread; out
of a population of 62,789, only 3,055 died in the year
1812, 3,095 in the year 1813, and 3,301 in the year 1814.
From the middle of September 1813 to February 1814,
478 civilians and some 1,800 soldiers succumbed in Breslau
to typhus fever; the total number of soldiers that died
between the middle of September and the beginning of March
was 3,400.<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c011'><sup>[128]</sup></a> In the governmental district of Liegnitz,
having a population of 600,000, according to Kausch<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c011'><sup>[129]</sup></a> only
13 physicians (excluding the surgeons) died. The disease
was borne by transports of infected soldiers into other parts
of Silesia, and at the end of the year 1813 all the military
lazarets in Silesia were infected. In Waldenburg and vicinity
(Obersalzbrunn, &amp;c.) typhus fever broke out after the soldiers
had marched through on October 20 and November 25, 1813,
and seventeen days later the disease was very widespread,
all the members of many families having contracted it.
In Bunzlau typhus fever raged with unusual fury; in the
military lazaret 12,000 men are said to have died between
June 1813 and March 1814.</p>

<p class='c007'>Presently typhus fever appeared, with the arrival of the
remnants of the Grand Army, in regions further away from
the Russian border. Häser<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c011'><sup>[130]</sup></a> describes the manner in which
the disease spread, always along military roads, as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>‘French soldiers returning from Russia’, he says, ‘spread
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>the contagion of various diseases over a large part of Central
Europe. Almost naked, or clothed in torn and half-burned
rags, without shoes, their feet covered with straw, and their
frozen limbs covered with festering sores, they marched
through Poland and Germany. Typhus fever and other
diseases associated with it marked their course. The inhabitants
of the country were forced to house the sick; but
teamsters also conveyed the infection to villages which the
soldiers did not visit. The disease raged most furiously in
the hospitals, which scarcely anywhere were able to meet
even the most modest demands made upon them.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Regarding the appearance of typhus fever in Berlin we
are informed by Hufeland and Horn.<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c011'><sup>[131]</sup></a> First to occur there
(in the months of February and March 1813) were numerous
cases of ‘nervous fever’, which was doubtless typhoid fever.
Still it is likely that cases of typhus fever also occurred at
that time, for Horn, in writing about ‘nervous fevers’ in
the Charité, describes the exanthema with the same words
that Hufeland uses in reference to later cases. Among
these patients there were already some who had returned
from Russia.<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c011'><sup>[132]</sup></a> At all events, in the first part of March 1813
there occurred cases of contagious typhus, which was
brought to Berlin by French, and later by Russian soldiers;
the observed ways of infection, regarding which Hufeland
informs us, are mentioned above. In the middle of April
there were 246 typhus-fever patients in the Charité. In
order to prevent the disease from spreading in this hospital,
Hufeland adopted strict measures of precaution. The
patients were all carefully isolated on the second floor,
which was shut off by means of a grating. The newly-arrived
patients were supplied with clean, fresh linen, their
clothing was disinfected for several days in hydrochloric
acid, and then washed in boiling water containing lye,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>while objects of no value were burned. The sick-rooms were
constantly ventilated by leaving the windows open, and were
thoroughly cleaned every day. The physicians, surgeons, and
attendants, before they entered the sick-rooms, had to put
on black mantles of glazed linen, and on leaving the rooms
they had to wash their hands and faces in cold water and
rinse out their mouths. In this way the disease was prevented
from spreading in the hospital itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the battle of Leipzig typhus fever broke out anew in
Berlin; according to Horn, 144 cases of ‘nerve fever’ were
received into the Charité in January 1814, 92 in February, 54 in
March, 14 in April, 8 in May, and none in June. Regarding the
total mortality in the epidemic of typhus fever in Berlin, which
in the year 1813 had about 155,000 inhabitants, the following
table, compiled by Gurlt,<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c011'><sup>[133]</sup></a> gives us information; there died in:</p>

<p class='c007'>Typhus fever appeared throughout the entire province of
Brandenburg. Maier<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c011'><sup>[134]</sup></a> gives us some information regarding
the city of Brandenburg, where ‘infectious nerve-fever’
disappeared in the latter part of May 1813, and where,
after the battle of Leipzig, it again broke out, but did not
become very widespread. On October 27 prisoners from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Baden and Hesse were quartered there; they remained until
October 31 and then went on to Ruppin. Among them were
some convalescents from a military lazaret in Saxony, who
infected the occupants of all the houses in which the prisoners
were quartered. Between November 5 and December 6
there were 38 ‘nerve-fever’ patients in the Altstadt
and 7 in the Neustadt, a small number of whom died.
Typhus fever raged very furiously in Jüterbog after the
battle of Dennewitz, carrying away entire families.</p>

<p class='c007'>After his defeat in Russia, Napoleon had quickly returned
to France, and there, by means of new conscriptions, had
in a short time assembled an army of very young men, who
had never done military service and were therefore not
accustomed to the hardships of war and, in particular, were
much more susceptible to infectious diseases than the troops
that had served under him before. In April, when the army
of the Allies had arrived at the Elbe, Napoleon with his
newly-gathered army left the Rhine and marched to Saxony,
which from then until autumn was the main scene of the war.
Since the Russian army was still infected with typhus
fever, contracted in the winter campaign, and since, furthermore,
isolated cases of the disease were still occurring among
the remnants of the French troops that had returned from
Russia, the inevitable result was that Saxony was not only
completely impoverished by the protracted war, but was
also terribly afflicted by war pestilences.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Saxony typhus fever had already become very widespread
in the first few months of 1813; all the places through
which the military transports passed were attacked, as Sorau,
Guben, Lübben, Görlitz, Leipzig, and Weissenberg; while
places in which military hospitals were erected fared even
worse, as Schneeberg, Zwickau, Chemnitz, Freiberg, and
Augustusburg. The severe epidemic in Annaberg (in the
Saxon Erzgebirge), lasting from March to May 1813, has been
described by Neuhof.<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c011'><sup>[135]</sup></a> In March a Saxon field-hospital was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>established there, and presently everybody who came in
contact with the hospital contracted typhus fever. In
neighbouring Thum, where the patients passed only one
night, many citizens succumbed to the disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dresden, in the first few months of the year 1813, was
not attacked by the disease, notwithstanding the fact that
soldiers and officers returning from Russia were taken sick
and died there; only in rare instances were citizens, in
whose homes officers had been quartered, attacked, and the
disease did not rage at all extensively.<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c011'><sup>[136]</sup></a> On the other hand,
typhus fever raged furiously in Dresden after Napoleon’s
successful battle at Bautzen (May 20 and 21, 1813), when
large numbers of wounded soldiers were brought to Dresden
and placed in lazarets, which soon became greatly overcrowded.
The less-severely wounded were housed in the
homes of citizens, who were compelled to receive them and
suffered terribly in consequence of it. The result was that
typhus fever spread from the soldiers to the civilians. After
the battle of Dresden (August 26, 27), from which Napoleon
again emerged victorious, but especially during the short
siege of Dresden (from the middle of October to November 11),
the epidemic increased in both extent and fury. The increased
mortality is shown by the following table, which
includes only the residents:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>According to Fischer, one person out of every ten that
contracted the disease died, while the mortality in the
French military hospitals was incredibly high. In the course
of the year 1813 no less than 21,090 soldiers died in Dresden,
while in the same year 5,194 residents died; 3,273 civilians
died in the year 1814, and 1,785 in the year 1815. The
average number of deaths per annum among the civil
inhabitants was 2,304.</p>

<p class='c007'>Regarding the terrible conditions in Dresden at that time,
a pastor informs us in a letter:<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c011'><sup>[137]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c024'>It was a gruesome sight to see the wagons full of naked corpses,
thrown together in the most horrible positions, drive away from the
hospitals and set out for their destination. Many bodies are said to
have been cast into the Elbe. The terrible days began about the
middle of May, when many house-owners were obliged to quarter as
many as two, three, and even four hundred men. Presently persons
suffering from wounds, scurvy, and infectious disease began to arrive
from Bautzen, some straggling along piteously on foot, others being
rolled along in ghastly groups on pushcarts. This disease-spreading
mass was now housed in the homes of citizens, since the twenty-five
hospitals were no longer able to accommodate them. The houses,
yards, streets, and public squares were full of dirt and refuse. Dearth
of food, resulting from the breakdown of means of supply, added to
the general misery. Entire families were wiped out, and many
houses are still standing empty (1814). Wagons bearing the dead
clattered on all the streets, and there were few inhabitants who did
not wear some outward sign of mourning for lost relatives.</p>

<p class='c006'>Leipzig suffered even greater hardships. The pestilence
was conveyed thither by French soldiers in February 1813,
and on the 27th of that month there were thirty-eight fever
patients in the Jacobsspital. In the summer of 1813, when
the war was going on in Saxony, the disease raged there
furiously. After the battle of Dresden a large percentage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>of the wounded were brought to Leipzig, and more than
20,000 sick and wounded soldiers were kept there for several
months. As usual, typhus fever broke out in the city in
consequence of it, and carried away large numbers of soldiers
and citizens. After the battle of Leipzig upwards of 30,000
wounded soldiers, mostly Frenchmen, were housed in the
city. ‘Virulent nerve-fever,’ says Beitzke,<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c011'><sup>[138]</sup></a> ‘which had been
prevalent in the city for some time, now broke out with
tenfold severity, not only in the city itself, but also in the
surrounding country, and carried away large numbers of
people. The arrival of the cold weather, which helped to
check the disease, was under these circumstances a great
blessing.’ In the year 1813 some 80,000 French soldiers,
according to the hospital lists, succumbed to wounds, war-typhus,
and other diseases, in Leipzig. From February 1813
to January 1814, seventeen young physicians died there of
typhus fever. The number of civilians buried in Leipzig in
the year 1813 was 3,499, in the year 1814 it was 2,022; the
average number of interments in the years 1810–12 was 1,443,
and in the years 1815–17 it was 1,187. The number buried
(including the still-births, but not the soldiers) was, by
months:<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c011'><sup>[139]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In reference to the year 1813, in which typhus fever
caused the greatest devastation in Leipzig, we see how the
mortality among persons between the ages of ten and sixty
increased between fourfold and fivefold, while among very
young children and very old men, it increased by at most one
hundred per cent. In the year 1813 more men than women died
(1,900 men and 1,599 women), whereas in the following year
the reverse was the case (1,009 men and 1,013 women).</p>

<p class='c007'>Typhus fever spread throughout all Saxony. In Plauen,
which was at that time a city of 6,800 inhabitants, the
following number of deaths, according to Flinzer,<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c011'><sup>[140]</sup></a> were due
to typhus fever: 4 in 1812, 32 in 1813, 59 in 1814, and 5 in
1815. These figures do not include the foreign soldiers that
died. According to Flinzer, the specific disease before the
year 1819 was usually typhus fever. In the year 1814 the
total number of deaths in Plauen increased to 440.</p>

<p class='c007'>Numerous sick, wounded, and captive soldiers were quartered
in Zwickau after the battle of Leipzig. There and in
the surrounding villages, in consequence of the erection of
a hospital, typhus fever had already appeared in September,
but in Zwickau itself, thanks to timely measures of precaution,
it gained no headway. In the year 1812 only 183
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>civilians died there, 376 in the year 1813, and 260 in the
year 1814; 380 soldiers died there in 1813, and 14 in the
year 1814.<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c011'><sup>[141]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The pestilences spread all over the country, even into the
most remote corners of the Saxon Erzgebirge; Annaberg
and the neighbouring towns of Marienberg, Weipert, and
Geyer were again attacked, although less severely, according
to Neuhof, than in the spring. In March the disease
disappeared entirely.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Saxon strongholds along the Elbe fared worst of all;
regarding the terrible devastation caused by typhus fever
in Torgau we shall have something to say in the tenth
chapter. Magdeburg and Merseburg were also severely
attacked; this is evident from the fact that one-half of
the physicians in Magdeburg (nine in number) succumbed,
according to Roloff, to hospital fever.<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c011'><sup>[142]</sup></a> In Wittenberg,
whither typhus fever was borne in February 1813 by
infected French soldiers, and where it had subsequently
disappeared, the mortality was very high during the siege,
which lasted from October 28, 1813, to January 14, 1814;
of 6,000 or 7,000 inhabitants, upwards of 4,000 had left the
city before the siege began. In the course of seven months
(July 1813 to January 1814) 590 people died there, whereas
the average number of deaths had been only 300 per annum.
When the city was captured by the Prussians the death-rate
increased; no less than 331 persons died between January 14
and April 14, 1814.<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c011'><sup>[143]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>After the battle of Leipzig the defeated army marched
back through Weissenfels, Naumburg, Weimar, and Erfurt
to the Main. There was now no active effort made to supply
food to the army, which still numbered some 100,000 men;
the soldiers had to eat whatever they could pick up along
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>the way. ‘Extreme misery and exhaustion’, says Beitzke,<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c011'><sup>[144]</sup></a>
‘led to great excesses; the places along the route were made
to suffer, and worst of all, the region through which the
French army hurried back was generally infected with the
germ of typhus fever.’ ‘The route of the army, clear to
Mayence,’ says Giraud,<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c011'><sup>[145]</sup></a> ‘was again strewn with corpses
and débris.’</p>

<p class='c007'>In Weissenfels some 3,000 soldiers are said to have died
in the hospitals, and also 600 civilians, within a year. In
Altenburg, which had suffered from typhus fever in the
spring of 1813, 1,650 men and 55 officers died between
October 2 and December 1 of that year. In Eisenberg (in
Saxe-Altenburg), according to Greiner,<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c011'><sup>[146]</sup></a> a lazaret was established
in the fall of 1813, but there were but few cases of
typhus fever transmitted to citizens owing to the adoption
of all measures of precaution. On the other hand, the
disease was conveyed to numerous near-by villages, in which
large numbers of sick and convalescent soldiers were quartered.
‘The Cossacks did the most toward spreading the
disease, for wherever any of them were quartered, one could
count with certainty upon an early outbreak of nerve-fever.’
In November 1813, a severe epidemic of typhus fever broke
out in Gera, and the mortality in four months was seven
times as high as usual. In Zeulenroda (south of Gera) the
pestilence was not very severe; it was brought there by
sick and convalescent soldiers, who were quartered in the
houses.<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c011'><sup>[147]</sup></a> Jena, on the other hand, was very severely attacked:
the epidemic began in November 1813, and lasted
until March 1814.<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c011'><sup>[148]</sup></a> According to Gurlt, the usual number
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>of deaths in normal years in the districts of Weimar and
Jena was from 1,750 to 1,850; but in the year 1813 no less
than 3,948 people died there, and in 1814 there were 3,363
deaths.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the battle of Lützen (May 2, 1813) some 8,000
wounded French and Prussian soldiers came to Erfurt,
necessitating the immediate erection of lazarets. After the
battles in August, when the scene of the war moved closer
to Erfurt, the misery in the city was greatly increased,
resulting in a rapid dissemination of typhus fever. In the
latter part of August, when 9,000 sick and convalescent
soldiers arrived in the city, the citizens were obliged to
quarter them; the number of soldiers that succumbed to
typhus fever was appalling, while as many as 17 civilians
often died in a single day; in the week before the battle
of Leipzig 504 soldiers died in the hospitals. On October
20–23 the French lazarets were cleaned out as thoroughly as
possible. During the siege, which began on October 25 and
lasted seventy-three days, the misery was extreme, and
typhus fever raged more and more furiously. From November
1 to November 17 some 400 civilians died, while no less
than 1,472 soldiers died in the military hospitals; 143
soldiers died on December 9 and 10. The houses of a few
citizens were rendered absolutely tenantless. In the year
1813 Erfurt lost 1,585 citizens, as compared with an average
of 554 for the years 1811–12; the number of deaths in the
year 1814 was 1,121. Typhus fever also raged so furiously
among the Prussian besiegers, that the lazarets were soon
overcrowded, and it was necessary to house the troops in
other places.<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c011'><sup>[149]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In Fulda, which was forced to take in thousands of sick
soldiers, typhus fever soon began to spread rapidly, as it also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>did in the country surrounding the city. In Giessen, where
a Russian field-lazaret for 1,800–2,000 men was erected,
the epidemic soon spread to the civil inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Hanau the French retreat was opposed by General
Wrede with an army of 50,000 Bavarians and Austrians,
a much smaller number than the French had. The two
days of fighting that ensued (October 30 and 31, 1813)
caused the pestilence to develop murderously. Kopp has
given us a good description of this epidemic in Hanau.<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c011'><sup>[150]</sup></a>
Since the beginning of the war the city had always had
a military hospital, which lay outside the city. During the
battles in Saxony the number of sick and wounded increased,
so that it was necessary to erect a second lazaret within the
city. Many sick-attendants and sub-surgeons contracted
typhus fever, which was prevalent in the hospitals, and
several cases also occurred in the city, especially among
people who quartered soldiers for money in their homes;
many soldiers were thus crowded together in small rooms,
and among them were a great many convalescents from
Saxon hospitals. The infectious nature of the disease and
its consequent dangerousness was shown by the fact that
as a rule entire families gradually contracted it, although
the epidemic was confined to individual houses. The engagement
at Hanau, from which the French emerged victorious,
resulted in the unfortunate city being stormed and plundered.
‘Even while the battle was going on,’ says Kopp,
‘a corps of the French army scattered throughout Hanau.
This corps had brought with it from Saxony the germ of
infection; for the region around Dresden could be looked
upon as the great breeding-place where, in view of the
enormous assemblage of people representing so many nations,
and owing to the concurrence of so many unusual factors,
the soil was uncommonly fertile for pestilential diseases.’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>After the engagement a multitude of French prisoners,
greatly weakened by hardships and hunger, came to the
city. The dissemination of typhus fever was especially
helped along by the fact that many poor inhabitants engaged
in looting on the battlefield, and took home with them the
knapsacks and other effects of the dead. The clothing of
the dead came into the possession of those who were charged
with burying them, and later got into the hands of the
poorest families in the city and in the neighbouring villages.
‘I often entered the houses of poor people,’ Kopp goes on
to say, ‘and found the entire family suffering from typhus
fever, and on the walls of the low sick-room the uniforms,
shirts, and other effects of the dead soldiers would still be
hanging.’ The result was that the number of patients
greatly increased after the battle, and in less than two weeks
an epidemic began to develop; at first it was rather mild,
but later on it carried away large numbers of people, and
lasted until the end of February, having reached its climax
in December. From December 1, 1813, to January 4, 1814,
248 people died, whereas the normal mortality for the month
of December was but 30. The total number of deaths,
including the soldiers, between October 26 and March 1 was
613, while in ordinary years only 125 people died, on the
average. The middle class suffered worst of all, while of
the upper classes three physicians and several clergymen
died. Of the 192 typhus-fever patients that Kopp himself
treated, 21 died (10·9 per cent), but these figures do not
include a rather large number of very mild cases. People
of all ages and both sexes were attacked; children suffered
less than adults, while old people and heavy drinkers were
the most liable to succumb. The disease lasted from two
to three weeks; death usually occurred on the fourteenth
to twentieth day, often somewhat sooner.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frankfurt-on-the-Main suffered terribly in the year 1813
from enforced quartering. Even in the spring, after the
newly-organized French armies had passed through the city,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>the Frankfurt lazarets were overcrowded with sick and
wounded soldiers from Saxony, which was then the scene
of the war. Accordingly it was decided in Frankfurt to
build barracks adapted to the expected requirements; and
in order to protect the city as much as possible from the
infection of typhus fever, the barracks were erected outside
the city limits, before the Allerheiligen Tor, and were situated
in the Pfingstweide along the Main. The building of
these barracks was a large and very expensive undertaking,
but they undoubtedly served a very useful purpose by protecting
the inhabitants for a considerable length of time
against the infection of typhus fever.’<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c011'><sup>[151]</sup></a> On September 21
and 22 large numbers of sick and wounded soldiers came
to Frankfurt; they filled all the lazarets, and many of them
had to be quartered in the homes of citizens. From that
time on typhus fever began to spread throughout the city.
Fortunately for Frankfurt, the retreat of the French army
from Hanau to Mayence passed by the city, since the French
generals were afraid that they would be unable to get their
troops out of Frankfurt again. On October 29 all the sick
and wounded French soldiers in the Frankfurt hospitals
were taken out and conveyed by boat to Mayence. The
hospital on the Pfingstweide, which had room for 1,480
patients, was immediately cleansed and made ready for the
army of the Allies, who were marching into Frankfurt in
large numbers. Typhus fever now reached its climax. The
arrival of the German and Russian armies almost doubled
the number of people in the city; the soldiers were quartered
in the homes of citizens and immediately infected
them with the pestilence. On January 14, 1814, there were
more than 4,000 typhus-fever patients in the city alone,
while in the district their number far exceeded 6,000. How
the mortality among the civil inhabitants was thereby
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>increased is shown by the following figures, which include
only the deaths in the civil population:</p>

<p class='c007'>Four physicians and seven surgeons succumbed to the
epidemic in Frankfurt. Of 668 typhus-fever patients taken
in by the Hospital zum Heiligen Geist, 100 died. Generally
speaking, Frankfurt-on-the-Main fared pretty well, for the
reason that most of the patients were housed outside the
city; the lower classes, particularly servants and maids,
suffered the most. In the city itself the disease was confined
chiefly to the narrow streets of the Altstadt. In March
and April the pestilence began gradually to abate, and in
May it ceased altogether.</p>

<p class='c007'>After leaving Hanau the retreating French army went on
to Mayence and France. The great loss of human life due
to typhus fever during the siege of Mayence will be discussed
in the tenth chapter. Wiesbaden<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c011'><sup>[152]</sup></a> was attacked very
severely; 800 men are said to have died in the military
lazaret there, while of the native inhabitants, who numbered
4,000 at that time, 466 contracted the disease and
141 succumbed to it.</p>

<p class='c007'>From Mayence the pestilence spread and infected the
Rheingau; the outbreak in Oestrich (below Hattenheim on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>the Rhine) is described by Thilenius.<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c011'><sup>[153]</sup></a> In October sick and
wounded French soldiers were taken down the Rhine, and
in the latter part of that month 500 soldiers on three boats
were held up by a severe storm at Oestrich, where the bad
weather compelled them to remain for twenty-four hours.
The patients, contrary to orders, left the ships and were
taken in by the inhabitants of Oestrich. Before they went
away fourteen of them died; a number had already died on
the boats. On November 7 five or six citizens of Oestrich
contracted the disease; before the 9th more than thirty
had been taken sick, and on the 10th there were 93 typhus-fever
patients in the city. All told, 330 people in Oestrich
contracted the disease, and 103 succumbed to it. In the
latter part of November neighbouring places were infected
by dispersed French soldiers, by the small lazarets of the
troops of the Allies, by visits to the sick, and by participation
in funeral ceremonies. Particularly hard hit was the
town of Kiedrich, where 336 people contracted the disease
and 69 succumbed to it.</p>

<p class='c007'>As in Oestrich, so in Winkel (near Rüdesheim), according
to J. B. von Franque, the pestilence broke out on November
5, 1813, when a boat-load of infected French soldiers
was driven ashore there; sixty or seventy of the patients
entered the village of Winkel, where they were housed in
a schoolroom. Presently a large number of the inhabitants
(91 all told) contracted the disease, and 31 of them died.
In the small neighbouring community of Espenschied the
pestilence broke out in a Prussian military lazaret and
spread to all the houses with the exception of one.</p>

<p class='c007'>Kraft<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c011'><sup>[154]</sup></a> gives us some interesting information regarding
the appearance of typhus fever in Runkel-on-the-Lahn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>(above Limburg). This outbreak affords an example of
how quickly the pestilence spread in small places. Shortly
after the arrival of the Allies, traces of lazaret fever revealed
themselves there, and in the latter part of November 1813,
several sick soldiers were brought there and housed in the
homes of citizens. Presently typhus fever broke out all
over the town; in the first part of December the castle at
Runkel was converted into a lazaret, and it was very soon
filled with patients. The poor allowed themselves to be
employed for short periods as sick-attendants, and the result
was that they either contracted the disease themselves or
else conveyed it to their homes; it was not long before the
entire town, as well as the surrounding country, was infected.
The convalescents from the military lazarets were not isolated
in separate houses, but taken to the surrounding towns and
villages (for example, Weyer, Villmar, Münster, and Erfurt),
many of whose inhabitants were taken sick. The pestilence
raged far and wide; at the climax of the epidemic (February
to the middle of March) entire families lay sick, and a great
many physicians and surgeons were attacked; the disease
disappeared about the middle of May. In Runkel itself,
which had 850 inhabitants, 214 contracted the disease and
70 died; the total number of deaths between December 1,
1813, and July 1, 1814, was 94, whereas the normal number
of deaths for an entire year was but 17. In the village of
Münster, which had 760 inhabitants, 86 were taken sick
and 22 died; and in the village of Weyer, which had 727
inhabitants, 179 were attacked and 58 died; the average
number of deaths per annum in both villages was 12. As in
these small places, so in all the towns and cities the pestilence
broke out wherever a sick soldier of either army passed.</p>

<p class='c007'>From October 28 on, transports of half-dead typhus-fever
patients for several days kept arriving at Limburg itself,
where they were sheltered in a convent. In only eight days
several inhabitants living near the lazaret, and also several
sick-attendants and their families, contracted the disease.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>In consequence of the quartering of Russian and Prussian
troops in the homes of citizens, and also in consequence of
the erection of a permanent hospital in the city, into which
hundreds of patients were received every day, typhus fever
broke out with great severity among the inhabitants; the
climax of the epidemic came in January. Of 600 civilians
who contracted the disease 76 died.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Grand Duchy of Nassau, to which the last-named
places (Wiesbaden, Oestrich, Rüdesheim, Runkel, and Limburg)
belonged, and which had some 270,000 inhabitants,
the number of people who contracted the disease and the
number who died from it, according to the reports of the
church and town authorities, was recorded for the period
between October 1, 1813, and April 1, 1814. According to
von Franque, the following figures were compiled in reference
to the civil population in the Governmental Districts of that
time:</p>

<p class='c020'>Altogether, fourteen per cent of the population were attacked
by typhus fever, and three per cent succumbed to it;
scarcely a single community was spared.</p>

<p class='c007'>Epidemics of typhus fever also occurred further down
the Rhine; Coblenz, for instance, was severely attacked.
According to Bernstein,<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c011'><sup>[155]</sup></a> a small epidemic broke out in
Neuwied in January 1814, having been borne thither by
a Prussian corps under General Kleist, which left behind
eighty-two sick soldiers, many of them suffering from ‘nerve-fever’.
The disease spread in a rather mild form throughout
the city, but lasted only four weeks.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Typhus fever likewise appeared in North Germany, which
was not directly infected by French soldiers retreating from
Leipzig. Hamburg was attacked with great severity. In
March 1813, the Russian colonel, Tettenborn, by means of
a bold <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de main</span></i> had captured Hamburg, but he was
unable to hold it, and on May 30 the French returned.
Marshal Davoust erected strong fortifications and drove out
all the poorer inhabitants, most of whom had come from
the neighbouring Altona, and thus made ready for a long
siege, which did not begin until the end of the year, although
the blockade was complete by the middle of January. Large
quantities of filth accumulated in the streets, since all working-men
were employed at the redoubts and hospitals. Food
became more and more scarce. ‘On such a fertile soil’,
says Th. Deneke,<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c011'><sup>[156]</sup></a> ‘typhus fever flourished. The disease
spread rapidly from the hospitals throughout the entire
city, since not only were all arrangements wanting for the
isolation of the patients, but half-recovered patients were
actually discharged from the hospital and quartered in the
homes of citizens. Of the garrison, which at the beginning
of the siege numbered some 25,000 or 30,000 men, sixty or
seventy, at one time as many as 100, died every day between
the first part of February and the last part of March, and they
were all buried outside the Steintor, close by the town-moat.
No less than 10,700 bodies were interred there, 8,200 people
having succumbed to typhus fever, and 2,500 to wounds;
among those buried were numerous prisoners. Regarding
the number of inhabitants that died we have no information.
The condition in the hospitals must have been terrible; since
there was not sufficient room or the proper facilities to take
care of the patients, the physicians and attendants did their
duty only under constraint, and the managing officials in
many instances grossly abused their authority; one of them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>the director of the Legert Military Hospital, for example,
ended characteristically by becoming in 1824 the leader of
a band of robbers in France.’ Seven physicians fell victims
to the pestilence in Hamburg. The city did not surrender
until May, after the capture of Paris, whereupon typhus
fever appears to have disappeared quickly.</p>

<p class='c007'>From Hamburg typhus fever was conveyed by fugitives in
all directions; Altona was attacked with particular severity.
As mentioned above, thousands of the poor driven from
Hamburg had been received in Altona. ‘The people,
driven from their homes by fear,’ says Steinheim,<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c011'><sup>[157]</sup></a> ‘streamed
through our gates and went about seeking shelter. At the
same time the gates of Hamburg were closed, and swarms
of unhappy people, the dregs of Hamburg’s population,
straggled with the sad remnants of their property, bent over
more by sorrow than by the weight of their burden, through
our gates and found protection, nourishment, and shelter in
our homes; it was a heart-rending sight.<a href='#f106' class='c011'><sup>[106]</sup></a> They were housed,
partly in barracks, stables, and barns, and partly in the houses
of the lower-class citizens, whose homes were thereby ‘so
crammed full that not a single corner was left unoccupied
by some poor stranger’. More than 17,000 refugees were
received in Altona, whose normal population at that time
amounted to some 24,000. At the beginning of January,
when the very cold weather came (the thermometer often
went down as low as –20 degrees Réaumur), all the cracks
and openings in the doors and windows were stopped up to
prevent the entrance of the outside air. In the latter part
of December 1813, typhus fever broke out in these overcrowded
quarters and carried away large numbers of people.
The exact number is unknown; according to Mutzenbecher
1,138 fugitives, all told, died in Altona. According to other
reports sixty-eight per cent of the patients in the hospital
succumbed. The epidemic reached its climax in March, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>with the coming spring it began to abate, partly because it
became feasible to house the fugitives in better quarters, and
partly because the warmer weather rendered better ventilation
possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>The disease was also conveyed from Hamburg to Eppendorf,
but no information regarding the number of deaths there is
available.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Lübeck typhus fever broke out in March 1814, among
refugees from Hamburg, and carried away 613 people.
According to Gurlt, typhus fever was conveyed to Bremen,
partly by the army of the Crown Prince of Sweden, and
partly by fugitives from Hamburg; the epidemic is said
to have been rather mild.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Mecklenburg typhus fever began to spread after the
erection of a military lazaret in Malchow (October, 1813),
and after the erection of a second lazaret by the Swedes in
Wittenburg (near Schwerin).</p>

<p class='c007'>In Kiel typhus fever did not appear until the beginning
of the year 1814; Weber<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c011'><sup>[158]</sup></a> attributed the outbreak there to
the Swedish military lazaret, in which physicians and nurses
frequently contracted the disease. At first the poorer people
were attacked (probably because the sick-attendants were of
that class), and later the well-to-do. The pestilence, mild at
first, soon became very severe. The disease also broke out
in other places in Holstein; Pinneberg was severely attacked,
and the disease was also observed in Schleswig. It is
remarkable that, according to Weber, no exanthema was
observed in Kiel; it must, however, have been present
in a scarcely noticeable form, since a rash appeared on the
entire skin of convalescents. The disease always began
with a chill, and was characterized now by obstinate constipation,
now by diarrhoea; no patient who survived the
thirteenth day died. And even if an exanthema was not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>observed, there can be no doubt that it was typhus fever
which raged in Kiel. Weber himself calls the disease contagious
typhus.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>4. The Appearance of Typhus Fever in South Germany</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>Typhus fever was conveyed to various places throughout
South Germany by the few soldiers that returned from
Russia. Nowhere did it become very widespread, since the
authorities soon realized its dangers and prevented it from
spreading by means of appropriate measures of precaution.
A change took place, however, after the battle of Leipzig,
when large numbers of fugitive and captive French soldiers
came into the country, and when troops, particularly
Russians, kept constantly marching back and forth across
the country and spreading the infection. Another important
cause of the appearance of the disease there was the fact
that lazarets were erected in South Germany during the
campaign in France, for the purpose of sheltering the sick
and wounded soldiers that were transported back from
France.</p>

<p class='c007'>Regarding the dissemination of typhus fever in Bavaria we
are very well informed in a dissertation by F. Seitz.<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c011'><sup>[159]</sup></a> As among
other divisions of troops, so also among the Bavarian division,
typhus fever raged extensively. On the march from the
Vistula to the Oder thirty or forty men contracted the disease
every day, and some of them also suffered from diarrhoea,
dysentery, and other diseases; so that when Crossen-on-the-Oder
was reached only 113 officers and 2,253 men were
left. During the sojourn in Crossen and during the march
through Saxony in March, the number of the patients
increased, and by the middle of March there were only
1,000 able-bodied men left. Thus they arrived at the Bavarian
border. ‘The rumour of the wide prevalence of nerve-fever
in North Germany,’ says Seitz, ‘and the apprehension that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>the disease might be conveyed into Bavaria by soldiers
returning from the field of battle, had preceded the arrival
of the first warriors. Nevertheless people did not wish to
forgo the pleasure of sheltering in their homes the soldiers,
who had been exposed to so many hardships and privations,
and of helping them to forget their past troubles; and in
performing this philanthropic duty they lost sight of the
necessary caution which prudence demanded.’</p>

<p class='c007'>The infection of an entire family in Regensburg by a soldier
discharged from the hospital (in February 1813), and reports
regarding infection in other places, resulted in the adoption
of strict measures in the border-towns. All returning
soldiers, if it was suspected that they were infected with
disease, were examined by a commission, and if the suspicion
was confirmed by this commission, they were not allowed to
be quartered in the homes of citizens, but were obliged to
find shelter in barracks and lazarets, or in suitable buildings
outside the town. Patients were sent to the military hospitals
of Bayreuth, Bamberg, and Plassenburg (near Kulmbach);
as soon as these hospitals were filled up, a new one was
erected in Altdorf. Strict isolation of the patients was
enforced, and this prevented the further dissemination of
the disease among the civil inhabitants. To be sure, a few
people contracted the disease after coming in contact with
soldiers; for example, in Amberg, Sulzbach, Burglengenfeld,
Grafenau, Cham, Nuremberg, &amp;c. On the other hand, there
were a great many typhus-fever patients in the military
hospitals, especially in Bamberg. There typhus fever caused
a high mortality among the soldiers; but, thanks to strict
measures of precaution, only a few civilians were taken sick
(about 100 out of 20,000 inhabitants), while of several physicians
that contracted the disease only two succumbed to it.
About the middle of the year 1813 typhus fever disappeared
in Bavaria, without having demanded many victims. The
‘nerve-fevers’, which were prevalent during the summer
(for example, in Regensburg from July to September), are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>not regarded by Schäfer as contagious, and must be looked
upon as cases of typhoid fever.</p>

<p class='c007'>In November, on the other hand, after the battles near
Leipzig and Hanau, typhus fever broke out suddenly in
many places in Bavaria, and in December raged furiously.
The orders, issued in the spring of 1813, prohibiting all
persons suspected of carrying disease from crossing the
borders could no longer be enforced. Says Seitz:<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c011'><sup>[160]</sup></a> ‘When
French prisoners began to march across the country on their
way from Saxony and Würzburg to Bohemia, the pestilence
spread among the inhabitants of the cities and of the flat
lands. Typhus fever raged in its most terrible form among
these poor prisoners of war; many succumbed to it in
various places along the route, and thousands died in the
hospitals. That the disease, which haunted all defeated
armies like a ghost, would necessarily reap an abundant
harvest among them, was clear to every physician who
observed the physiognomies of these warriors as they were
being led away in captivity from the vicinity of their fatherland
into remote regions. Their pale faces and emaciated
forms bore witness to hunger and sorrow, to a long deprivation
of the usual necessaries of life and to lack of vital energy,
to exhaustion caused by the long marches from Hanau to
Leipzig, when in the ardent struggle to reach their fatherland
they had used up their last ounce of strength. Whosoever
was brought by profession, sentiment, or curiosity into
contact with these unfortunate soldiers sooner or later
contracted the disease. Physicians, police-officers, servants,
national guards (who watched over the prisoners), country-people
(who carried the patients), messengers (who brought
food to the soldiers in their quarters), were as a rule the first
to be attacked.’</p>

<p class='c007'>The Grand Duchy of Würzburg was next attacked. In
Würzburg itself, where there were 2,000 or 3,000 French
patients in the hospitals, the pestilence broke out furiously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>wherever the soldiers went. In Miltenburg more than
100 persons contracted the disease in the latter part of
December; in the district of Mellrichstadt the number of
typhus-fever patients was 429 (121 deaths), and in the district
of Bischofsheim there were 1,067 patients and 328 deaths.
According to Seitz, the number of deaths throughout the
entire Grand Duchy of Würzburg, which at that time had
a population of 344,500, was 2,500, while no less than 16,000
people contracted the disease. In Nuremberg the pestilence
did not become very widespread; it broke out in the first
part of November and lasted until the middle of January;
150 persons, all told, contracted the disease. Dinkelsbühl
was severely attacked; in the month of November a large
number of French prisoners suffering from typhus fever and
diarrhoea were housed there in the Carmelite Monastery, and
in a short time some 200 of them died. Between the 25th and
30th of November typhus fever spread to the civil population,
and, in a few days, more than 100 people contracted the
disease and 10 died; the number of patients increased until
December 12, and then decreased, until the pestilence
disappeared in the latter part of January; 448 persons, all
told, contracted the disease and 89 succumbed to it.
In the middle of November it was conveyed by a transport
of French prisoners to Bamberg, where it spread with such
fearful rapidity in the military hospital there, that twenty
persons died every day and all the sick-attendants and medical
assistants contracted it. The disease soon spread throughout
the city, even infecting people who had in no way come in
contact with the sick prisoners. Epidemics of typhus fever
were reported in twenty-one villages in the surrounding
country.</p>

<p class='c007'>All Upper Franconia, through which transports of prisoners
were taken to the Bohemian border, suffered terribly from
the pestilence. The disease was first observed in the towns
and villages lying to the north of Bamberg, whither it had
been conveyed by dispersed troops immediately after the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>battle of Leipzig (in Nordhalben, Hof, and other near-by
villages). Later on it also appeared in the districts further
south. The region between Bayreuth and Münchberg was,
comparatively speaking, less severely attacked. On the
other hand, typhus fever raged furiously in the military
hospital on the Plassenburg, where at the end of December
there were some 700 persons suffering from the disease. In
Kulmbach, a town lying at the foot of the mountain, more
than 100 persons contracted the disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>While French prisoners were bringing typhus fever into
the country from the west, Austrian and Russian troops
were also bringing it from the east. To be sure, the authorities
were enjoined to restrict the foreign troops to the use of
ten military roads that passed through the country, but the
Austrian and Russian leaders frequently ignored these
instructions. Consequently the pestilence spread over the
entire region, a fact which Seitz confirms with numerous
specific instances; regarding the extent to which it raged
in Munich, he gives us no information.</p>

<p class='c007'>Typhus fever was conveyed to Regensburg by French
prisoners. ‘Toward the end of the month [December],’
says Schäfer,<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c011'><sup>[161]</sup></a> ‘typhus fever was conveyed to Regensburg
by French prisoners, some of them sick and some of them well,
but all of them scantily clad and half-starved. They were
quartered in the dance-halls, and those that were sick were
taken to a convent which had been hastily converted into
a hospital. There the civil inhabitants, owing to the lack
of appropriate arrangements, were obliged to distribute
food among the sick, and the result was that the fever
finally became general. Not until then was the advice
which the physicians had given at the beginning heeded;
they had urged, namely, that the patients should be cared
for by the hospital-attendants themselves, that each one
should have his own separate attendant, and that only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>those persons should be allowed to enter the hospital whose
presence was absolutely necessary.’ By February, according
to the official report, 308 persons, all told, contracted typhus
fever in Regensburg, and 51 succumbed to it.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Ingolstadt an unusually severe epidemic broke out after
the arrival of the French prisoners. In the first part of
December the number of prisoners that died every day was
no less than ninety, but after the middle of the month the
mortality was somewhat lower. On December 18 there were
845 typhus-fever patients in the hospitals, and the number
of deaths on this day amounted to only twenty-seven.
From then to the end of the month only fifteen or twenty
persons died per diem. On December 10 several civilians
contracted the disease; on December 18 the number of
civilians suffering from the disease was thirty-six, and about
an equal number on December 30. The total number of
deaths among the prisoners of war amounted to 2,000.
Typhus fever also appeared along the Danube on both sides
of Ingolstadt.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the course of the winter, typhus fever was also borne
into southern Bavaria by Austrian troops; it broke out in
the towns along the military road, e.g., in Vöcklabruck,
Traunstein, Rosenheim, and Landsberg. Places which the
soldiers did not visit were also attacked by the pestilence.
In Weilheim (west of Lake Starnberg) the disease broke out
repeatedly after soldiers had marched through the place;
up to April 8 no less than 885 persons had contracted the
disease there, and some 100 had succumbed to it.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to Seitz, 18,427 cases of the disease and 3,084
deaths attributable to it were officially recorded in Bavaria
between October 1813 and June 1814; the lists kept by the
Governmental Districts were undoubtedly very incomplete,
but on the other hand we must assume that the contagious
and non-contagious ‘nerve-fevers’ (typhus and typhoid)
were not always distinguished. For the several districts
Seitz furnishes us with the following figures relating to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>number of people who contracted and succumbed to typhus
fever:</p>

<p class='c007'>This does not include the number of deaths among the
prisoners of war, nor among the native and foreign soldiers.
For the Main region, Seitz also furnishes figures relating to
the age of the patients; of the 5,752 persons who contracted
the disease 453 were children, 1,345 were young men and
women, 3,657 were of middle age, and 297 were old men and
women.</p>

<p class='c007'>As in Bavaria, so also in Württemberg, typhus fever broke
out in two epidemics; the first, which was less extensive
and less severe, was caused by soldiers returning from
Russia, and the second broke out in consequence of the
passing of troops through the country after the battle of
Leipzig. According to Elsässer,<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c011'><sup>[162]</sup></a> in the first part of the year
1813 there were 165 cases of typhus fever and twenty deaths
due to it reported from fifteen different localities. In the
month of July the disease disappeared from Württemberg.
At the end of the year 1813, however, the disease was again
borne into the country, partly by French prisoners, and
partly by Russian soldiers. ‘Throughout Württemberg’,
says Lohnes,<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c011'><sup>[163]</sup></a> ‘this fever appeared wherever foreign troops
had tarried. Consequently contagious typhus first appeared
in the northern lowlands, while the region around Tübingen
and the southern and eastern part of the country at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>beginning did not suffer at all. But in December, when
large bodies of troops marched through the highlands, the
southern part of Württemberg, these fevers followed the
soldiers’ lines of march. At first it was the French prisoners
who carried lazaret-fever with them wherever they went,
and a very severe form of the disease too; later on, these
fevers always broke out wherever the Russian soldiers went,
although very few of the soldiers themselves were infected
with them. Frequently persons contracted the disease
who had no sick soldiers in their homes. As a rule the disease
in such cases was mild, but it was very dangerous wherever
patients were left or congregated in large or small hospitals.’</p>

<p class='c007'>As early as the month of February, the disease had reached
its climax in Württemberg; in March it began to abate
rapidly, so that in the first part of the summer only 150
patients could be counted in fifteen Governmental Districts.
From then until the end of the year it broke out only sporadically.
Braun,<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c011'><sup>[164]</sup></a> who asserts that more than half of the
physicians in Württemberg contracted typhus fever, mentions
the names and residences of seventeen physicians who
succumbed to it; we see from this list that the disease was
prevalent throughout all Württemberg. The disease was also
conveyed to the southern part of Upper Swabia. According
to Dillenius, 1,300 sick soldiers were sent in the first part of
the year 1814 from France (especially from Mülhausen in
Alsace) to the military hospital at Tettnang; twenty-four
of them died on the way, and in the course of the following
four months five times as many succumbed to typhus fever
in the hospital.<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c011'><sup>[165]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Baden suffered severely from typhus fever; in Karlsruhe,
for instance, typhus fever raged from October to December
1813. But Baden suffered particularly, for the reason that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>all the sick soldiers in the Bohemian army were sent back
there from France. Their number far exceeded all expectations,
since typhus fever was uncommonly prevalent in the
field army in France, and the soldiers arriving from there
infected the hospitals. Even when the Austrian and Russian
troops marched through the country the number of ‘nerve-fever’
patients was very large. Freiburg im Breisgau, at that
time a city of 9,000 inhabitants, suffered very severely in
consequence of enforced quartering; some 210,000 soldiers
were housed in the homes of its citizens. In the garrison
lazaret and university hospital, which together had room for
500 patients, no less than 1,200 patients were crowded
together in December 1813; almost all of them were suffering
from diarrhoea and typhus, and owing to the lack of linen
they were compelled to lie in their own dirty clothes on sacks
of straw. Every morning two large wagonloads of dead
bodies were driven away for burial. As usual, the pestilence
spread to the civil population, carrying away entire families.
On October 12, 1813, the former Abbey of Thennenbach was
converted into a military lazaret, in which two weeks later
some 1,200 patients were sheltered, although it had adequate
room for only 700. Between December 27, 1813, and
March 1814, 567 soldiers succumbed there, most of them to
typhus and dysentery. The epidemic reached its climax
about the middle of January, when as many as thirty
persons died per diem. After the middle of January the
number of deaths rapidly decreased.<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c011'><sup>[166]</sup></a> Northern Baden was
also attacked. In Mannheim the sick and wounded French
soldiers who arrived after the battles of Lützen and Bautzen
were led around the city and taken to Spires. Thus typhus
fever did not appear in Mannheim itself, where the condition
of health was subsequently also good. The statement of
the <em>Rheinische Merkur</em>, that out of 13,000 patients in the
military lazarets in Mannheim 3,347 died, according to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>Gurlt,<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c011'><sup>[167]</sup></a> is incorrect; the number of deaths was no more
than 346.</p>

<p class='c007'>Regarding the total number of deaths due to typhus fever
in Baden no information is available; at all events it was
very large. This is shown by the fact that in the last part of
1813 and first part of 1814 no less than thirty-five physicians
and thirty surgeons of the first class fell victims to the
pestilence.<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c011'><sup>[168]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In November 1813, thousands of scattered French prisoners
came to Darmstadt; many of them were suffering from
typhus fever, which soon spread throughout the city. Many
places in that part of the present Grand Duchy of Hesse
which lies south of the Main were severely attacked by the
epidemic; as many as 2,000 or 3,000 inhabitants of many
places contracted the disease. But by July 5, 1814, it had
everywhere disappeared.<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c011'><sup>[169]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>5. Typhus Fever on the Left Bank of the Rhine; France and Switzerland</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>The continued retreat of the French army passed from
Mayence through Metz to Paris, and the route of the retreat
was marked by patients left behind. In this way the epidemic
of typhus fever was quickly transplanted to the north-eastern
part of France. Alsace-Lorraine, the Palatinate, Champagne,
and Burgundy were all attacked in succession. The epidemic
raged from Kreuznach to Strassburg; the dispersion of the
retreating army caused even the smallest villages to suffer,
so that the pestilence appeared in Worms, Frankenthal,
Spires, Oppenheim, Neustadt-on-the-Hardt, Dürkheim,
Landau, Alzey, Trabach, Zweibrücken, Weissenburg, Hagenau,
Zabern, and in other places. Mörs (near Frankenthal) was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>almost completely wiped out.<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c011'><sup>[170]</sup></a> The following places in France
are mentioned as having been attacked by the pestilence:
Saint-Avold, Courcelles-Chaussy, Mars-la-Tour, Sierck, Cattenom,
Pont-à-Mousson, Toul, Nancy, Étain, Verdun, Bar,
Longwy, and Sedan. Thouvenel describes the epidemic of
typhus fever in Pont-à-Mousson, which broke out in December
1813, when transports of sick soldiers arrived there, and
spread to all the surrounding towns and villages; it increased
in severity until the middle of March, and by June had almost
disappeared. He describes in emotional language the endless
succession of wagons that arrived every day:<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c011'><sup>[171]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c024'>Who of us will not remember as long as he lives those harrowing
scenes, which one cannot describe without shuddering? Who will
ever forget those hundreds of wagons filled with unhappy wounded
men who had had no medical care since leaving Leipzig; and packed
in with them were sick men suffering from dysentery, typhus fever,
&amp;c., almost all of them dying of inanition, weakness, and filth, as
well as of disease. Those unfortunate men piteously begged only for
a place in a hospital already filled with dying men, only to receive in
reply a forced refusal. And so they were under the cruel necessity
of going further to die, with the result that they infected all the
towns and villages along their route, wherever they were granted
a generous hospitality.</p>

<p class='c006'>Strassburg, comparatively speaking, suffered but little.
As early as December 1, the prefect of Strassburg had issued
orders that a special building should be set aside in every
town for the reception of sick soldiers that arrived there,
and that they should under no circumstances be housed in
the homes of citizens. In October and November convalescents
had been quartered in the residences of citizens,
who had subsequently been infected. In November the
number of typhus-fever patients, which averaged ten or
fifteen per month, increased to thirty-six, and in December
to 100. In accordance with the above-mentioned decree all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>newly-arrived soldiers were examined by a Board of Health;
the sick were sent to the hospital, and the healthy were
quartered with citizens. ‘Notwithstanding this,’ says Reisseisen,<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c011'><sup>[172]</sup></a>
‘the healthy ones infected a large number of inhabitants
through their old woollen overcoats, which were
thoroughly saturated with the miasma of the hospitals.
The clothes that were sold privately were particularly dangerous,
so that in the latter part of December strict orders
were issued to keep watch for the old clothes and burn them.
In the first part of January, when the rather lax siege began,
typhus fever spread irresistibly throughout the city; in
that month the pestilence reached its climax with 175 deaths.
On January 22 the prefects ordered general fumigations in
all public buildings, and recommended that the citizens
should also fumigate their homes. The result was very
successful; in February 112 people died, in March 75, and
in April 27, and then typhus fever disappeared. No foreign
troops marched through the stronghold, and although all
the French prisoners of war passed through the city, no
more citizens were infected by them, for the reason that they
were quartered in the fortifications.</p>

<p class='c007'>The devastation caused by the pestilence in Metz was no
less than frightful. Maréchal and Didion<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c011'><sup>[173]</sup></a> give us a picture
of this severe epidemic. On November 19, 1813, some
5,000 sick soldiers were assigned to that city; it was necessary
to see that they were sheltered, and at the same time
measures were adopted to prevent the disease from spreading.
According to the report of the astute Mayor of Metz,
Baron Marchant, the 5,000 soldiers, all of them suffering
from an infectious disease, arrived, and sixty of them died
every day. All the physicians in Metz contracted the
disease, and several of them died. It was impossible to
procure sick-attendants, since those who had performed this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>service had all contracted the disease, conveyed it home,
and infected their families. Sick soldiers who were quartered
privately, and particularly convalescents, also helped
to spread the disease throughout the city; more than 150
houses were infected. In the latter part of December the
number of patients greatly increased. On January 1, 1814,
after Blücher had crossed the Rhine, the Germans marched
against Metz, and then an enormous crowd of people from
the surrounding country fled to that city for protection.
This caused typhus fever to spread far and wide throughout
the city. Furthermore, sick and exhausted soldiers were
constantly being sent to Metz, and it is estimated that some
30,000 of them arrived there. The worst month was February,
and 7,752 soldiers, all told, died in six months:</p>

<p class='c020'>1,294 civilians also died, the largest number (371) likewise
in February. In the entire Department of Moselle, which
at that time had some 400,000 inhabitants, no less than
10,329 people succumbed to this epidemic, and this number
does not include the soldiers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Regarding the wide dissemination of typhus fever in the
Departments east and south of Paris, which formed the
scene of the war in the first part of the year 1814 (the Departments
of Haute-Marne, Côte-d’Or, Aube, Yonne, Marne,
Seine-et-Marne), no further information is available. Troyes,
Besançon, Dijon, Avallon, and Auxerre are mentioned as
places that were attacked by the pestilence.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Paris, cases of typhus fever occurred in February,
when the war moved closer to that city. The sick and
wounded soldiers were consequently obliged to go to the
hospitals in Paris; but since these were neither large nor
numerous enough to accommodate so many patients, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>became necessary to open several provisional hospitals in
appropriate buildings. At first all the typhus-fever patients
were taken to the Hôpital de la Pitié, but it soon became
necessary to change this policy, since the disease had spread
throughout all the wards of that building. In the latter
part of February the first cases of typhus fever appeared in
the city, in consequence of the return of many soldiers to
their own families. In March more and more people contracted
the disease, which toward the end of the month was
raging furiously, though more in the hospitals than in the
city. In the Hospice de la Salpêtrière, which had been converted
into a military hospital and began to be used on
February 9, 1814, a small number of persons contracted
typhus fever in the latter part of March, and in the months
of April and May the disease spread; after that, however,
it began to abate. A great many nurses and attendants
were taken sick.<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c011'><sup>[174]</sup></a> In April a large number of people in the
city were lying sick with typhus fever. In one boarding-school,
from which several persons visited the hospitals and
brought typhus fever home with them, thirty people contracted
the disease and four succumbed to it. In May cases
of typhus fever became more rare, and in August no more
people contracted the disease. The mortality in Paris in
the year 1814 was very high; whereas in the years 1812 and
1813 the number of deaths had been 20,133 and 18,676
respectively, in the year 1814 no less than 27,778 people died,
which number includes 2,559 soldiers that died in the hospitals.
In the year 1815 the number of deaths decreased
again to 19,992. How large the number of deaths due to
typhus fever was, it is impossible to state with certainty,
since in the case of only a small number of the persons who
actually died of typhus fever was that disease recorded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>as the cause of death. The rubric ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fièvres putrides et
adynamiques</span>’ increased in the year 1813 from 1,337 deaths
to 2,860 deaths, and the rubric ‘fièvres malignes ou ataxiques’
from 804 to 1,376.<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c011'><sup>[175]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Owing to the overcrowded condition of the hospitals in
Paris, soldiers were conveyed upon a number of boats on
the Seine to Rouen. Since sick and wounded men were
thus transported together, typhus fever was conveyed to
Rouen, where it carried away large numbers of persons
employed in the hospitals. In the same way, sick and
wounded were transported to points on the Loire, causing
typhus fever to spread to Tours, where 860 soldiers succumbed
to it.<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c011'><sup>[176]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The proximity of the scene of the war in January and
February 1813 caused typhus fever to break out in the Swiss
Cantons lying close to the French border; for example, in
the cantons of Basel-Stadt, Basel-Land, Neuenburg, Solothurn,
and Waadt. The number of deaths in these cantons
was:<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c011'><sup>[177]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>The country in Austria which was most exposed to the
ravages of the epidemic of typhus fever was Bohemia, along
whose borders the war was for a long time carried on. As early
as February 1813, ‘nerve-fever’, accompanied by petechiae,
was borne by Bavarian and Prussian troops into the district
of Königgrätz, but thanks to energetic and strict measures
of precaution, it did not become very widespread. The
principal outbreak of the epidemic in Bohemia took place
in the autumn of the year 1813. The number of typhus-fever
patients taken into the Prague hospital in September
1813 was 39, in October 77, in November 196, and in December
287.<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c011'><sup>[180]</sup></a>  The region along the Saxon border suffered the
most: e.g. the districts of Leitmeritz, Saaz, Rakonitz, and
Elbogen. In the Leitmeritz district typhus appeared in
August, and became more severe in September and October;
the places along the military road leading from Dresden to
Prague were particularly hard hit. The epidemic lasted
until April. In the near-by Kaurzim district sick and
wounded soldiers of all nations arrived, after the battles
of Pirna, Dresden, and Kulm, causing a virulent epidemic
to break out everywhere; in many places all the inhabitants
contracted it. In the latter part of the year, when the
pestilence seemed to have abated a little, it broke out anew
when the French garrison was being taken from Dresden
to its place of detention; in fourteen days 2,422 persons in
sixty places contracted the disease, which disappeared in
May. Typhus fever had spread over 103 localities, all told,
in that region, and of 8,066 people who contracted it, 751
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>succumbed. In the Saaz district typhus broke out in the
last part of October 1813, and carried away large numbers
of people; it raged all along the military road in the vicinity
of the scene of the war. The highest mortality was in the
month of December, and in May the pestilence disappeared.
In the Rakonitz district entire communities lay sick in the
first part of the year, but in April no new cases of the disease
occurred. In the Elbogen district typhus fever broke out
in September 1813 in the city of Eger, in consequence of the
arrival of French prisoners and fugitives; the epidemic soon
spread over the entire district, and lasted until March 1814.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rest of Bohemia suffered less severely from typhus
fever in the winter of 1813–14. In the Beraun district,
lying to the south-west of Prague, it began in October 1813,
when the homes of the citizens became crowded with convalescing
soldiers; the epidemic came to an end in March
1814. The number of people who contracted the disease was
3,807, while the number who succumbed was 296. The adjacent
districts of Pilsen and Kattau were likewise attacked;
in the Pilsen district typhus fever broke out in October 1813,
in consequence of the arrival of French prisoners; a number
of places were infected by them, so that in November and
December it developed into an epidemic, which lasted until
April. Of 1,185 people who contracted the disease, 237 died.
In the Kattau district 645 contracted the disease and 132
succumbed.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the eastern part of the country the districts of Tabor
and Czaslau were severely attacked. ‘In the Tabor district’,
we read in the above-mentioned report,<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c011'><sup>[181]</sup></a> ‘there appeared
in the month of August at Neuhaus, where a field-hospital
had been erected, several biliary-mucous nerve-fevers, which
broke out in numerous places along the road to Prague, soon
spread to the Tabor district, and became epidemic. They
quickly revealed their presence in all places where sick
soldiers passed the night, or where the natives took part in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>the transportation of sick soldiers.’ The climax of the epidemic
was in January, and in the middle of May it disappeared;
of 4,267 people who contracted the disease, 448
succumbed. In the Czaslau district, adjacent to the Tabor
district on the north, the disease was disseminated in
November 1813 by transports of prisoners and troops, by
the quartering of convalescents in the homes of peasants,
and by peasants who helped to transport sick soldiers. On
December 16, 1813, no less than 4,313 civilians in thirteen
places were suffering from typhus fever. The highest mortality
prevailed in the vicinity of the hospitals; the epidemic
disappeared with the arrival of spring.</p>

<p class='c007'>Typhus fever was also conveyed into various parts of
Moravia,<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c011'><sup>[182]</sup></a> partly by Austrian troops, and partly by French
prisoners; in the districts of Brünn, Iglau, Olmütz, and
Teschen it broke out in numerous places. In twelve communities
in these districts, having a combined population
of 28,267, some 2,126 people contracted the disease between
December 1813 and the summer of 1814, and 207 persons
succumbed. In March the epidemic disappeared almost
everywhere. According to the figures compiled by J. Hain,<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c011'><sup>[183]</sup></a>
the number of deaths in Moravia and Austrian-Silesia
together was:</p>

<p class='c020'>In the rest of the country few diseases appeared, despite the
fact that troops kept marching back and forth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Typhus fever was conveyed by marching troops to Styria
also; the source of the pestilence was the seven military
hospitals in Graz. We read in the report:<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c011'><sup>[184]</sup></a> ‘The pestilence,
proceeding principally from the seven military hospitals
lying within the city limits as from a focus, was spread
abroad by convalescents, attendants, physicians, &amp;c. The
mortality in these hospitals was extremely high; the buildings
set aside for the purpose could scarcely accommodate
the number of sick. Everything was topsy-turvy; the
corps of field-doctors on hand was not nearly large enough
to take even the most necessary care of the large number
of patients.’ The region around Graz, Marburg, and Bruck
was most severely attacked by the disease, which also spread
to Carinthia and broke out in Klagenfurt and vicinity.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>7. Survey of the Epidemic of Typhus Fever in the Years 1813–14</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>It is impossible to draw an accurate picture of the loss of
human life which typhus fever caused in the years 1813–14.
This is due, on the one hand, to the lack of reliable statistics,
and, on the other hand, to the fact that the several regions
suffered to a varying degree, depending upon the number
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>of troops, prisoners, and refugees that they received. The
number of persons that succumbed to typhus fever in Germany
during the years 1813–14 must be estimated at least
as high as 200,000 or 300,000. Assuming that 200,000
people succumbed to the disease, the number that contracted
it would amount to some 2,000,000. Since Germany
at that time had hardly more than 20,000,000 inhabitants,
some ten per cent of them, on the basis of this assumption,
contracted the disease. The size of this number is significant,
when we consider that the stronger and older people
manifested particular susceptibility to the disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the chief causes of the wide dissemination of typhus
fever in the years 1813–14 was the imperfect development
of the lazaret system. If at first a lazaret for infectious
diseases was available, the number of patients it was called
upon to accommodate in a few days became so large that
new buildings always had to be opened for them, and it was
impossible to keep them isolated. The efforts of the various
municipal administrations to have the lazarets erected
outside the city limits were powerless against the brutal
obstinacy of the French, and, later, of the Russian generals.
The severity of the penalty which they had to pay for
unceremoniously housing infected French troops in strongholds
together with healthy men, is evident from the fearful
devastation caused by typhus fever in Danzig, Torgau,
Mayence, &amp;c. The little communities were absolutely helpless
against the dominating power of the soldiers. One
might reproach the municipal administrations of that time
with failing to adopt measures of prevention against the
menacing danger of pestilence, particularly in places which
did not suffer in consequence of the marching back and
forth of soldiers. But one must take into account the
excitement which permeated the entire people at that time—the
hopeful longing to be freed from the national enemy’s
long oppression, toward which all thinking and planning
was directed, the employment of all resources for this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>purpose, and in particular the fact that sheer ignorance
rendered appropriate measures impossible. If this ignorance
prevailed in the highest places, nothing better was to be
expected of the administrations of the smaller cities and
towns. The population was therefore everywhere defenceless
against the intrusion of the pestilence, which was given
an opportunity to become more and more widespread. This,
however, had not been the case in Central Europe since the
Thirty Years’ War.</p>

</div>
<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>1. The Russo-Turkish War of 1828–9</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>On April 28, 1828, Russia declared war against Turkey;
the fighting took place partly in the Balkan Peninsula, in
Wallachia and Bulgaria, and partly in Transcaucasia. In
the western scene of the war, the Russians, after the capture
of Varna and the futile siege of Schumla in the campaign
of the year 1828, were obliged to retire to the left bank of
the Danube; in the second campaign (1829) Diebitsch
defeated the Turks at Kulevtchi, marched across the Balkan
Peninsula, and appeared unexpectedly at Adrianople, which
the Turks surrendered to him without resistance.</p>

<p class='c007'>An unusually severe epidemic of bubonic plague accompanied
this campaign. In the year 1828 plague had spread
from Asia Minor to European Turkey and Wallachia; as
early as 1825 and 1826 it appeared in Bucharest, while
sporadic cases of the disease occurred in Wallachia in the
summer of 1827 and in the winter of 1827–8.<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c011'><sup>[185]</sup></a> On April 30,
1828, the first Russian troops made their appearance in
Bucharest; they were quartered in the city itself and in
the surrounding villages. On May 13 seven cases of plague
appeared in a private house, but the Bucharest physicians
did not hold the disease to be plague. Orders to disinfect
the houses were issued, but intercourse with the surrounding
villages was not stopped. Some thirty inhabitants succumbed
to the pestilence in May, and at the end of that
month three Russian soldiers were allowed to enter the city.
Since the number of cases in the city was increasing, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>troops stationed there were quartered in the village of
Fundeni, where, however, several more people soon contracted
the disease. During the month of May, plague
broke out in other villages of Wallachia, and in the course
of the summer and autumn it spread throughout the entire
country. In regard to the origin of this epidemic of plague,
Simon<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c011'><sup>[186]</sup></a> says: ‘All Wallachia was infected from the year
1826; but had it not been for the war and the consequent
afflictions of all kinds, the disease would not have developed
in the year 1828 into such a furious and extensive epidemic.
The arrival of the Russians was responsible for this widespread
outbreak, since they carried the infection contracted
from the inhabitants to a thousand different places.’</p>

<p class='c007'>The removal of the troops to Fundeni temporarily checked
the dissemination of plague in Bucharest, but in the
middle of August it broke out again, presumably in consequence
of the arrival of more troops from the scene of the
war; some thirty or forty villages were attacked by this
epidemic, which lasted until the middle of November. In
January 1829, plague was conveyed by troops to Moldau
and Jassy, which they were to make their winter quarters;
but the disease, notwithstanding the fact that it was wrongly
diagnosed and declared to be typhus fever, was soon checked
by energetic measures of precaution. Regarding the number
of plague patients in the Russian army, which was also
attacked by several other diseases, especially malaria, diarrhoea,
dysentery, and fever, no information is available; the
Russian army numbered 150,000 men, and, according to
Seidlitz, 134,882 men were received into the lazarets and
75,226 men into the regimental sick-rooms up to the end of
February 1829; thus 210,108 men contracted disease in
a period of ten months.<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c011'><sup>[187]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In March 1829, plague broke out anew. Surgeon-General
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>Witt, who had his head-quarters in Jassy, declared that the
disease was not plague, but an endemic fever, and put an
end to all measures of precaution in March. ‘After the
patients were no longer quarantined,’ says Czetyrkin,<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c011'><sup>[188]</sup></a> ‘the
disease, bringing destruction in its train, in the spring and
summer began to make headway and spread over Moldavia,
Wallachia, and Bulgaria; it also accompanied the Russian
army across the Balkan Peninsula and appeared in Rumelia,
where it completely wiped out several hospitals. Those
divisions of the army which were kept constantly on the
march and were thus exposed to the fresh air, rain, and dew,
suffered less severely; but the garrisons in the cities and
strongholds were more furiously attacked by the dreaded
enemy. The overcrowded condition of the lazarets, the lack
of competent nurses and physicians (most of whom were
exterminated by plague), the uncertainty regarding the
nature of the disease—all this constituted the reason why
the pestilence could not be checked.’</p>

<p class='c007'>The disease first appeared in March 1829 throughout
Wallachia, but after the middle of May it also revealed its
presence south of the Danube; Galatz, Babadag, Kustendji,
Mangalia, Bazardschik, and Kavarna were attacked in
succession.</p>

<p class='c007'>Varna suffered very severely; according to Petersenn,
the first cases occurred there in May 1829, in the infantry
regiment Witepsk. The patients were housed in tents on
the sea-shore outside the city, and since the number of
people who contracted the disease continued to increase,
all the patients in the hospitals were soon taken there. The
city was finally completely evacuated and closed up, after
the inhabitants had been assigned to definite places to live
in the open fields and in a near-by forest. The plague
reached its climax in the latter part of June. ‘There was
not a hospital,’ says Petersenn,<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c011'><sup>[189]</sup></a> ‘not a quarter of the city,
not a division of troops, not a family, not a single place,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>which had escaped infection, and everywhere one came
across victims of the pestilence, some dying and some dead;
for it spared neither sex nor age nor class.’ And in another
place the same physician says:<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c011'><sup>[190]</sup></a> ‘If the inside of the plague-camp
afforded a terrible sight, where sick men tossed about,
gasping in the burning summer heat, between the dead and
dying, the conditions outside of the plague-camp were no
more pleasant to witness; for along the roads from the city
to the hospitals, on fields and meadows, behind every shrub,
in every ditch, dead and dying men were stretched out
everywhere.’ And Seidlitz, who visited Varna when the
plague was at its height, asserts that the corpses were piled
up ‘like logs’ and carried away ‘by cartloads’. According
to Petersenn,<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c011'><sup>[191]</sup></a> the number of patients that died in the plague-hospital
at Varna was:</p>

  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c020'>At the end of August there were only a few plague-patients
in Varna. Of forty-one physicians, twenty-eight contracted
the disease and twenty succumbed to it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Conditions were as bad in many other places as they were
in Varna; Slobodzie, Kustendji, and Mangalia were likewise
devastated. In Brailow the first cases of plague occurred
in March; in April 132 persons succumbed to the disease,
in May 150, in June 774, and in July the pestilence abated.<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c011'><sup>[192]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>After the Russians crossed the Balkan Peninsula in the
summer of 1829, Adrianople, which was reached on August 12,
1829, was free from plague, and it remained free until the
end of the war. In the first part of November, however,
the plague broke out there in the large old barrack which
had been converted into a hospital and had become greatly
overcrowded. Patients, especially persons suffering from
dysentery, had been sent there from all sides, so that their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>number had increased on August 17 to 1,616, on August 27
to 3,666, and on September 1 to 4,641. On November 1,
when the head-quarters were removed from there, 6,000 sick
and healthy persons were left behind, the great majority
of whom fell victims to the plague. According to Rinck,
in the latter part of November ten or twenty soldiers suffering
from plague were taken there every day, and in the
middle of December not one of the 300 sick-rooms was
spared; from fifty to sixty plague-patients were taken in
every day at this time.<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c011'><sup>[193]</sup></a> In the middle of January 1830 the
fury of the disease abated a little among the Russians, but
it raged more and more destructively among the civil inhabitants,
who numbered some 80,000. In almost all the army-divisions
stationed south of the Balkans, plague broke out
in the winter of 1829–30; the entire army, therefore, before
returning to Russia, had to be quarantined twice for a period
of twenty-one days.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plague also revealed its presence in Transcaucasia, where
fighting was likewise going on. In Armenia it had broken
out shortly before the beginning of the Russo-Turkish War,
as also in Erzerum. The reinforcements coming from there
had brought plague to Kars, where it spread rapidly in the
Turkish army.<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c011'><sup>[194]</sup></a> In June 1828, when the stronghold of Kars
was stormed, the disease was borne by Turkish prisoners
back to the Russian army; but the strict measures of Field-Marshal
Count Paskewitsch prevented it from spreading
further in the army.<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c011'><sup>[195]</sup></a> But the inhabitants of Kars resisted
these orders, and the result was that plague continued to
rage there, partly in the garrison, which in twenty days had
530 plague-patients, and partly among the inhabitants, until
September. The plague was conveyed by Turkish prisoners
to Eriwan, to the region of Tiflis, and to other places. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>the stronghold of Achalzich, situated midway between Batum
and Tiflis, plague broke out in the year 1829; in the latter
part of February the stronghold was besieged by the Turks,
who were infected with plague. In consequence of a sortie
of the small garrison on March 6, which resulted in the
withdrawal of the Turks, since at the same time Russian
reinforcements were approaching, the plague was conveyed to
Achalzich, where the first cases occurred on March 10 in the
garrison, and shortly afterwards among the inhabitants. On
May 23 that part of the garrison which had been spared by
the plague was marched out into the open country, and the
stronghold was thoroughly cleansed, after which no more
cases were reported. In the fall of 1829 plague completely
disappeared from among the Transcaucasian troops, and
from the territory under their control.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>2. The Crimean War (1854–6)</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>The Crimean War plays a very conspicuous rôle in the
history of war-pestilences and of military sanitation; on
the one hand, it showed how severe a penalty an army has
to pay if, without measures of precaution, troops are sent
to the scene of the war from infected localities; on the
other hand, it showed that it is possible to prevent serious
outbreaks of pestilence if energetic measures are adopted
to provide good food and shelter for the troops. Whereas
the English soldiers suffered a great deal more from pestilence
in the first winter than the French soldiers, in the
second winter, in consequence of great improvements introduced
in the housing, clothing, and feeding of troops, the
English suffered very little, while the French suffered severely.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the year 1853 cholera made its appearance in several
places in France, and in the following year it spread over
the entire country; it raged most furiously in the southern
districts. Since the French troops, who were embarked at
Toulon and Marseilles, were consequently infected with
cholera, those suffering from the disease had to be put ashore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>from the first transport ship at Malta, and others at the
Peiraeus. When the troops disembarked at Gallipoli there
were thirteen cholera-patients among them, and these
were presently followed by other cases. Sporadic cases of
cholera then began to occur wherever the French soldiers
went, as in Nagara, Varna, Adrianople, &amp;c. The fact that
the disease was borne thither by French troops was frankly
admitted by most of the French military physicians; only
a few, for example, Cazalas, assumed that the disease was
already prevalent in Dobrudja.<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c011'><sup>[196]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>During the expedition undertaken by the French soldiers
to the unhealthy and deserted district of Dobrudja, cholera
broke out in the army like an explosion, compelling it to
return. The English soldiers during the siege of Varna,
and also parts of the English fleet, were likewise attacked
by cholera. Statements made by Scrive and Chenu regarding
the number of French soldiers that succumbed to the
pestilence diverge widely; according to Scrive, the French
army, which numbered some 55,000 men, lost 5,183 men
between July 3 and August 30, 1854, in consequence of
cholera,<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c011'><sup>[197]</sup></a> while Chenu gives us the following statistics:<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c011'><sup>[198]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>In September the scene of the war was transferred to the
Crimea, but there again cholera raged furiously in both
armies; in the winter of 1854–5, to be sure, it carried away
a relatively small number of men, but in the summer of 1855
it broke out anew with great severity. The total number of
deaths in the French army during the entire campaign was
12,467, in the English army 4,513, and in the Piedmontese
army 1,230. The size of the armies varied greatly; the
French army was largest in the latter part of the year 1855,
when it numbered 145,000 men; the total number of English
soldiers was 97,864, and that of Piedmontese soldiers, 21,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to Häsar,<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c011'><sup>[200]</sup></a> cholera spread far and wide from
the scene of the war—throughout Turkey, around the Black
Sea, in Greece, in Smyrna, along the coast of the Dardanelles,
in Constantinople, Odessa, Rumelia, and in the Danube
principalities; the inhabitants of the district of Dobrudja
also suffered severely from the pestilence, which after the
war spread over a large part of Russia.</p>

<p class='c007'>Scurvy also raged in the French army in the dry summer of
the year 1855, as well as in the severe winter following. In
August 1855 there were 2,581 scurvy patients in the army,
which was the largest number in the summer months, and
in February there were 4,341, the largest number in the
winter months. The outbreak of scurvy among the English
troops, who also suffered from the disease in the winter of
1854–5, was later checked by the consumption of better food.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dysentery was also very common: 6,105 French soldiers
suffering from that disease in the Crimea were taken to the
field-lazarets; 2,061 died there, and 2,792 were removed to
Constantinople. No less than 7,883 English soldiers contracted
acute and chronic dysentery, and 2,143 succumbed
to it.</p>

<p class='c007'>As early as the winter of 1854–5 a small number of cases
of typhus fever occurred among the French and English
soldiers; but not until the winter of 1855–6, between the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>months of December and March, did the disease become very
widespread in the French army in consequence of unfavourable
living conditions; the English army, on the other hand,
scarcely suffered at all during that winter. Scrive and
Chenu publish the following statistics relating to the French
army in the field-lazarets of the Crimea:</p>

<p class='c007'>According to Scrive, 11,124 typhus-fever patients, all told,
were taken into the field-lazarets of the Crimea between
September 1854 and July 1856; of these, 3,840 were removed
to Constantinople, and 6,018 died in the field-lazarets.<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c011'><sup>[201]</sup></a>
But Scrive says that this number of typhus-fever patients
is too small; it must have been increased by the number
of persons who contracted the disease in the field-lazarets
and hospitals, 4,502 of whom succumbed to it, and the number
who contracted and succumbed to it in Constantinople
and France, making 7,000 all told. According to Scrive,
therefore, the total number of deaths due to typhus fever
in the French army was no less than 17,515, from which he
assumes that at least 35,000 men contracted the disease.<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c011'><sup>[202]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In the English army typhus fever appeared only sporadically
in the winter of 1855–6; according to Chenu, 167 men
contracted the disease and 62 succumbed to it.<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c011'><sup>[203]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Among the Russian troops typhus fever raged furiously,<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c011'><sup>[204]</sup></a>
and according to A. Hirsch it was also very widespread in
southern Russia.<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c011'><sup>[205]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>In Constantinople, typhus fever, although it infected
numerous persons in the military hospitals, apparently did
not spread to the civil population. Baudens, who after
the capture of Sebastopol came to the Orient, says expressly
that the inhabitants of Constantinople were spared by the
epidemic during its entire course.<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c011'><sup>[206]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>According to Murchison, typhus fever was borne by
English troops to English soil, where in the years 1856–7
it caused epidemics in various parts of the country. The
following table indicates the number of typhus-fever patients
taken into the Fever Hospital in London:</p>

<p class='c007'>The increased number in London was not due to the fact
that the disease was brought over from Ireland, since there
were only fifty-three Irishmen among the patients, and only
two of them had been in the city less than three months.
On the other hand, the warlike events caused a famine,
resulting in much misery among the poor, and this favoured
the further dissemination of the disease.<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c011'><sup>[207]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>When the French troops were transported back to France,
energetic and extensive measures of precaution were adopted;
only those troops were allowed to embark who had for several
weeks been entirely recovered from typhus fever; several
stations for the discharge of men who contracted the disease
on the way were located along the coast of the Mediterranean
Sea, and sixty-two patients, all told, were left behind at
them; suspected divisions of troops, before disembarking
at Marseilles, were quarantined for a time on several islands
along the coast, on St. Marguerite (Îles de Lérins), on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>Îles d’Hyères, and on others, and before entering the city
they were examined again, bathed, and reclothed. The
result was successful. Laveran says:<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c011'><sup>[208]</sup></a> ‘The further one
went away from the seat of the infection, and the more the
soldiers scattered, the more the miasm seemed to lose strength;
in France the typhus-fever patients gave rise to only a few
cases inside the hospitals where they were being cared for;
the disease was never communicated to the civil population.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Sporadic cases were observed in Marseilles, Toulon,
Avignon, Chalon-sur-Saône, and in other places. A small
lazaret-epidemic also occurred in Paris in the Val-de-Grâce;
according to Godelier,<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c011'><sup>[209]</sup></a> almost all the patients there belonged
to the Fiftieth Regiment, which on November 30, 1855,
embarked at Kamiesch. The condition of health in the
regiment at that time was good, and, in particular, it was
free of typhus fever. Of the two ships on which the soldiers
were transported, the one took only thirty days to get from
Kamiesch to Marseilles and had no cases of typhus fever,
while the other, which had a harder voyage, took fifty days
and had numerous cases of typhus fever on the way; fifteen
patients were put into the hospital at Malta and twenty-five
in that at Marseilles. No less than fifty-eight soldiers in
this regiment contracted the disease in the Val-de-Grâce, and
they infected five nurses; eight soldiers and one nurse fell
victims to the disease.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>3. The North American Civil War (1861–5)</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>At the outbreak of the Civil War almost nothing was done
in the two armies to prevent the outbreak and dissemination
of diseases; the assembling of so many troops rendered
severe pestilences inevitable. The successful activity of
numerous voluntary societies did a great deal of good in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>way of improved methods of sanitation; the centre from
which this activity emanated was an officially recognized
Sanitary Commission, founded on June 15, 1861, which made
the prevention of pestilences its principal function. It was
enabled to carry on its work by large voluntary contributions
of money. The means which the Commission employed
were: good equipment, food, and shelter for the men, isolation
of men suffering from infectious diseases, burning of the
clothes, beds, and tents used by these patients, erection of
clean, well-ventilated barrack-lazarets, and comprehensive
plans for transferring invalid soldiers from the field-hospitals.<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c011'><sup>[210]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Since upwards of a million men, counting both sides, were
gradually brought face to face with one another, the loss of
human life was necessarily terrible. Regarding the losses
sustained by the Northern States, we are excellently informed

United States.<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c011'><sup>[211]</sup></a> The report also contains some statistics

the typhoid fevers and looked upon as typhoid fever, there

<p class='c007'>Regarding the appearance of typhus fever in the American
Civil War, views diverge. Since only a relatively small number
of cases of that disease are recorded, it is probable that
those cases were wrongly diagnosed, since typhus fever is
so highly contagious. In the health-reports of the Northern
States, in which the word typhus, as in England and France,
means typhus fever, we find the following figures relating
to the disease:</p>

<p class='c020'>But there are very few case-histories and absolutely no post-mortem
reports available from which one can draw a positive
conclusion. Laveran doubts the occurrence of typhus fever.<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c011'><sup>[215]</sup></a>
According to Niedner, on the other hand, typhus fever prevailed
among the Northern prisoners in the terribly neglected
prisons of Salisbury, North Carolina, and probably, too, in
other places.<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c011'><sup>[216]</sup></a> It is to be surmised that the increased number
of typhus fever patients in New York and Philadelphia,
&amp;c., which Hirsch adduces in accordance with the statements
of da Costa and Corse, was connected with the epidemic
among the prisoners.<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c011'><sup>[217]</sup></a> According to Corse, the number of
deaths due to typhus fever in Philadelphia was 37 in the
year 1862, 131 in 1863, and 335 in 1864.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unusually prevalent were diarrhoea and dysentery, so
that, notwithstanding their relatively mild character, they
caused a large number of deaths. The cases of cholera
reported were not Asiatic cholera, but a local form of the
disease. In the Northern army the following figures indicate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>the number of deaths due to acute and chronic dysentery
and diarrhoea:</p>

no less than 52 per cent of the white troops and 83 per cent

It is absurd to say, then, that the negroes are immune to

frequently and suffered a great deal more severely from it
than the whites. The troops in the military districts of

</div>

<p class='c013'>The Italian War of 1859, which the French and Piedmontese
together waged against Austria in Upper Italy, was not
attended by any severe pestilences, probably because it was
terminated in a comparatively short time, and the number
of troops engaged was not very large. To be sure, typhoid
fever and dysentery carried away many men on both sides,
while an unusually large number of soldiers contracted
malaria. Those fevers which were called ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fièvres rémittentes
épidémiques d’Italie</span>’, and which, notwithstanding their
frequent occurrence, caused only a few deaths, according to
Niedner were for the most part malaria, and not relapsing
fever. The Austrian army seems to have lost more men in
consequence of pestilences than the French army. Regarding
the spreading of the pestilences on a large scale from the
armies to the civil population we have no information.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>5. The Danish War of 1864</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>In the war of 1864, which Austria and Prussia waged
against Denmark, no epidemics of wide extent occurred.
‘The small number of men engaged,’ says Knaak,<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c011'><sup>[226]</sup></a> ‘the
not particularly unfavourable external conditions, the
constant communication between the fighting armies and
their home-countries, and the non-appearance of large
epidemics, all helped to render the health-conditions of the
war favourable.’ The total loss sustained by the Prussian
army, which reached a maximum size of 63,500 men, amounted
to 1,048 men; of these 738 died in battle, in consequence of
wounds, &amp;c., 310 succumbed to diseases, 193 of the latter
to typhoid fever. Statements regarding the number of deaths
in the Austrian army, which amounted to 25,000 men, are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>not available. The Danish army, which numbered 54,000
men, lost 1,446 in consequence of wounds, &amp;c., and 820 in
consequence of diseases.<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c011'><sup>[227]</sup></a></p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>6. The German War of 1866</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>As regards sanitation the German War of 1866 acquired
importance through the appearance of cholera on the scene of
the fighting. None of the other infectious diseases developed
very extensively during this war; of the Prussian army,
which numbered some 280,000 men, only 379, all told,
succumbed to typhoid fever, and dysentery did not appear
at all. A rather mild epidemic of small-pox spread throughout
a considerable part of Germany in the year 1865, and lasted
until the year 1866; whether or not the war helped the
disease to spread, which is not unlikely, we cannot state
with certainty owing to a lack of bases of comparison. The
German troops were well vaccinated, and the number who
contracted the disease was no larger during the war than in
times of peace. It is undoubtedly true, however, that the war
exerted an unwholesome influence upon the dissemination
of cholera throughout Germany and Austria.<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c011'><sup>[228]</sup></a> Cholera had
revealed its presence in Germany for the first time in the year
1865; it broke out in Altenburg, during its fourth passage
through Europe, having been borne thither from Odessa.
In the course of the year it broke out, in a comparatively
mild form, in many places in Saxony. In the year 1866 it
raged very extensively and furiously in the Rhine province
and in Westphalia, whither it was borne from Luxemburg;
in May cases of the disease occurred in several seaport towns
of Pomerania (Swinemünde, Stettin, Cammin, &amp;c.), and
in June it broke out in Hamburg, Berlin, Posen, Silesia,
East and West Prussia, and in the kingdom of Saxony.<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c011'><sup>[229]</sup></a>
Thus it came about that some of the troops enlisted came from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>infected parts of Silesia and Saxony, and the result was that
individual cases of cholera began to occur in the Prussian army.</p>

<p class='c007'>The disease was conveyed by soldiers from Stettin to
Leipzig, where it spread to the civil population; from
Leipzig it spread throughout Saxony and Thuringia. When
the Prussian army advanced into Bohemia the cases of the
disease began to increase, and after the battle of Königgrätz
(July 3, 1866) the dissemination of the disease was helped
along by the crowding together of large numbers of sick and
wounded soldiers. The rapid advance of the Prussian army
increased the disease’s rate of dissemination; on all the
army’s lines of march large numbers of sick soldiers were
left behind, for example, in Göritz, Gitschin, Königinhof,
Pardubitz, Czaslau, and Leitomischl. In Prague cases of
cholera were reported a few days after the city was occupied.
The pestilence was conveyed by Prussian soldiers to Moravia,
where it appeared in Prerau, Brünn, Iglau, Klosterbrück,
Znaym, and Nikolsburg. The further advance of the
Prussians conveyed it to Lower Austria; in Vienna it did
not break out until August.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some think that the pestilence was conveyed into Austria
from Bukowina, where it had broken out in May 1866.
When the war broke out, it is maintained, the disease was
conveyed by troops to the western crown-lands of Austria.<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c011'><sup>[230]</sup></a>
‘The truth’, says Niedner, ‘probably lies half way between;
the epidemic in Bohemia was disseminated chiefly by the
Prussian troops, but in the other Austrian countries by
Austrian troops.’ Daimer,<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c011'><sup>[231]</sup></a> one of the best authorities on
the history of pestilences in Austria, says: ‘In the year
1866 an epidemic of cholera came to an end in Bukowina,
where it was looked upon as the continuation of one that
had been prevailing in Turkey and Roumania; it spread
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>throughout the countries in which fighting was going on
at that time, and was borne by troops to remote regions.’
According to Presl,<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c011'><sup>[232]</sup></a> the number of deaths due to cholera
in the several crown-lands in the year 1866 was:</p>

<p class='c007'>In Prussia, too, cholera spread, in consequence of the war,

The disease broke out in the region of the Main and Tauber
and in the Odenwald, and in regions which had never before
been attacked by cholera. On July 24, 1866, Wertheim
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>received a Prussian garrison, which on the 26th was joined
by parts of the Hamburg contingent. As mentioned above,
cholera had already broken out in Hamburg in June, and
a few days after the arrival of the Hanseatic troops some of
them contracted the disease and were taken, despite the
objections of the local authorities, to the town hospital.
On August 6, cases of the disease appeared in the city, and
they constituted the beginning of a small epidemic which
lasted six weeks. On September 22 the epidemic was over,
after the population of 3,383 had lost 28 persons by death;
64 persons contracted the disease. In near-by Freudenberg,
of 42 people that contracted the disease, 23 died. In Schönfeld
two soldiers of the Hamburg contingent contracted the
disease on July 29; the first case among the civil inhabitants,
who numbered 524, was on August 2, and in a few days a small
epidemic began; 166 people contracted the disease and
55 succumbed to it. At the same time the Hanseatic troops
conveyed the disease to Gerlachsheim, where 61 persons contracted
it and 32 died of it, and also to Ilmspan, where
97 contracted it and 34 succumbed to it. On August 1 the
Hamburg soldiers came to Grünsfeld and brought four
cholera patients with them, and the result was that 177 of
the inhabitants, who numbered 1,458 all told, contracted
the disease and 23 of them died. The disease was conveyed
to Dittigheim by cholera convalescents of the Hamburg
contingent, and 225 persons contracted it there and 66
succumbed to it. In Gerlachsheim it appeared after a Saxon
ammunition-column, which was supposed to be absolutely
free from the disease, had passed through the city. In the case
of Walldurn, which had a very severe epidemic (the city had
3,339 inhabitants, and of these 827 contracted the disease
and 113 succumbed to it), it was impossible to prove that
the disease broke out in consequence of the arrival of the
soldiers. Külsheim, which was infected from Walldurn, had
only a small number of cases. Throughout Baden 1,774
persons contracted cholera and 404 succumbed to it. From
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>these statements it is very evident that the danger of an
extensive epidemic of cholera in the regions south of the Main
would have been very great, if the war had been carried on there
on a large scale, and had thus prevented the authorities from
taking measures to prevent the dissemination of the disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>The small epidemic in Uzmemmingen, a village of 700
inhabitants in the north-east part of Württemberg, was
brought about by a chamber-maid, who on August 25 brought
the disease from a Bohemian place through which a Prussian
detachment had passed; 60 persons, all told, contracted
the disease in Uzmemmingen, and 19 succumbed to it.<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c011'><sup>[235]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In the Bavarian Governmental District of Lower Franconia
cholera broke out, as in Baden, in consequence of the operations
of Prussian troops.<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c011'><sup>[236]</sup></a> In the last week of July there
were skirmishes between the Prussians and Bavarians near
Hettstadt and Waldbrunn; after the withdrawal of the
Prussians, many of whom were seized with diarrhoea, cholera
broke out in both of those villages. The outbreak in Miltenberg
was also connected with the arrival there of Prussian
soldiers. Presently other places in Lower Franconia were
attacked; for example, Rothenfels, Birkenfeld, Karbach,
Stadtprozelten, Tiefenthal, Waldbüttelbrunn, &amp;c. A Bavarian
authority gives credit for the non-appearance of the disease
in Remlingen and among the civil inhabitants of Uettingen,
where Prussian soldiers suffering from cholera lay, to the care
and vigilance of the Prussian military physicians. Cholera
also appeared in the Governmental District of Swabia,
breaking out in the cities along the Danube, in Höchstädt,
Dillingen, Gundelfingen, and Neuburg. But it was impossible
to prove that the disease was conveyed thither from the
scene of the war.<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c011'><sup>[237]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>In the Franco-German War of 1870–1, a larger number of
troops were assembled within a short time upon the field
of battle than in any previous campaign. On the German
side 33,101 officers and 1,113,254 men took part in the war;
the average number of men in the German field-army was
815,000. The total number of French soldiers under arms is
not definitely known; that it was enormous is evident from
the fact that the number of prisoners taken (including the
garrison in Paris and General Bourbaki’s army) amounted
to no less than 21,500 officers and 702,000 men. At certain
periods of the war huge bodies of troops were congregated
within comparatively narrow limits; at the battle of Gravelotte
(August 18, 1870) some 180,000 to 200,000 men faced
one another on either side; at the siege of Metz the average
size of the German investing army was 240,000 men, while
the French army in the city numbered 173,000 men at the
time of the capitulation. At the battle of Sedan (September 1,
1870) 124,000 French soldiers were opposed to nearly twice
that number of Germans. The garrison in Paris amounted
to about 250,000 men, while the German besiegers averaged
240,000 men.</p>

and were much of the time scantily fed, the number
of German field-troops that contracted and succumbed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>to infectious diseases was comparatively small. The total
loss sustained by the German army in consequence of injuries

<p class='c007'>Typhoid fever and dysentery were most prevalent, for
the reason that the troops were often quartered in places
where these diseases were already endemic. Regarding these
matters we are accurately informed by the ‘Health Report
relating to the German Armies in the War of 1870–1 against
France’, an exhaustive account published by the Medical
Division of the Prussian War Department.<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c011'><sup>[238]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>A total of 74,205 men in the German field-army contracted
typhoid and gastric fever, and 8,904 succumbed to them.
The eastern Departments of France, especially the city and
vicinity of Metz, were constantly afflicted with typhoid
fever. This explains why both the German besiegers and the
French defenders suffered so severely from that disease, the
dissemination of which was helped by the contamination
of the springs and water-courses, partly through excessive
use, and partly in consequence of the burial of dead men and
horses in close proximity to them. And while drinking-water
was for that reason brought from a distance, the water
used for other purposes was obtained in the immediate
neighbourhood. It is obvious that typhoid fever must have
raged extensively among the inhabitants of the villages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>surrounding Metz, the mortality in which during the siege
was three times as high as normal. This is evident from
a compilation of figures in the German Health Report,<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c011'><sup>[239]</sup></a>
indicating how the death-rate in these villages rapidly
decreased after the withdrawal of the Germans; per 100
inhabitants, there died in:</p>

<p class='c007'>Typhoid fever and dysentery were chiefly responsible for
this high mortality. As at Metz, so also at Sedan and Paris,
the troops suffered severely from typhoid fever.</p>

<p class='c007'>Large numbers of typhoid-fever patients were taken to
lazarets in Germany; the Prussian lazarets alone took in
30,507, of whom 1,376 died.</p>

<p class='c007'>Typhoid fever raged furiously among the French prisoners
of war, who usually brought the germ of the disease with
them from the scene of the hostilities. ‘Most observers’,
we read in the German Health Report,<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c011'><sup>[240]</sup></a> ‘agree that the disease
was most prevalent during the first three weeks after the
arrival of large transports of prisoners at their place of
detention; after that it gradually abated, and finally
appeared only sporadically.’ The military prisons, however,
while they often formed new sources of infection, did not
help to disseminate the disease, owing to the advanced
season of the year.</p>

<p class='c007'>It made considerable difference from what part of the
scene of the war the prisoners came; those coming from
Strassburg and Toul were much less severely infected with
typhoid fever than those from Sedan and Metz. This applies
particularly to General Bourbaki’s men, who manifested the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>least power of resistance to the disease. In Rastatt, for
example, there were at one time sixty prisoners suffering from
typhoid fever; of those who had come from Strassburg,
Neubreisach, and Schlettstadt 13·3 per cent died; of those
from Metz 14·5 per cent died, and of those from Bourbaki’s
army 40·6 per cent died. Of the French prisoners confined
in Germany (the maximum number was 374,995 and the
average number 262,496) 15,020 contracted typhoid fever
and 3,835 succumbed to it. The prevalence of the disease
among the German troops, as compared with its prevalence
among the French prisoners, is indicated by the following
table:</p>

<p class='c007'>The immediate vicinity of the places in which all these
French prisoners suffering from typhoid fever were confined
was necessarily unsafe to live in; and while the epidemics
that were brought about by people contracting the disease
there and conveying it abroad were always kept localized,
they were by no means confined to the very narrow limits
indicated, on the basis of scattered communications, in the
German Health Report. The reason for this moderate
dissemination is clear; at that time typhoid fever was
rendered much less prevalent throughout Germany by the
introduction of extensive sanitary measures (sewers, aqueducts,
refuse removal, &amp;c.), which prevented the disease
from constantly spreading from place to place. In Frankfurt-on-the-Main
the mortality due to typhoid fever was
not increased; the number of deaths per 10,000 inhabitants
was:</p>

<p class='c007'>In many cities, on the other hand, an increased number

was attributable to a transplantation of it from France, or
to a spontaneous outbreak of it among the many people in
these cities who already had the germ in their systems, it
is impossible to ascertain. From the statistics we are
scarcely ever able to make out the proportion of soldiers
and civilians that died. The number of deaths due to typhoid

<p class='c007'>In the case of Strassburg the increase caused by the war
is clear; of the civil inhabitants alone, 74 died in the year
1869, 137 in the year 1870, and 110 in the year 1871. In
the case of Elberfeld the increase began in the year 1870.
In Munich the increase began as early as the year 1869,
although the very high mortality did not commence until
1872, as in Berlin; in these two cases the increase cannot
be said to have been caused by the war. The same is true
of Plauen, where the increase also began in 1869. In
the case of Erfurt, unfortunately no statistics are available
for the year 1870; in the year 1871 the increase there is
very marked. To be sure, it is not expressly stated that
prisoners of war are excluded, but as they were not included
in the total mortality, or in that due to small-pox, we may

<p class='c007'>Since in the case of typhoid fever it is very often impossible
to trace the source of infection, it is not surprising that in
many instances it is difficult to prove that the disease broke
out in any specific locality in consequence of the arrival
there of a person, or group of persons, from an infected
locality. This applies, for instance, to the epidemic of typhoid
fever that occurred in Meiningen in the year 1871. In many
places the disease, being prevalent among the prisoners
detained there, undoubtedly spread to the civil population,
but nowhere did this occur to such an extent as to attract the
attention of the authorities.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the diseases that broke out in the field-armies
during the war of 1870–1, dysentery (epidemic dysentery)
played an important rôle, especially in the months of October
and November. Prior to the year 1870 it was a comparatively
rare disease in Germany, whereas in France it was quite
common. This is indicated by the fact that in the years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>1863–9 the number of deaths due to dysentery in the French
army (home stations) was twelve times as large as in the
Prussian army. Particularly hard hit were the troops in
and around Metz, where dysentery raged continuously and
with considerable severity,<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c011'><sup>[245]</sup></a> as well as in Strassburg and Sedan;
in the city and vicinity of Paris the disease, owing to the
advanced season of the year, raged less furiously. As a rule
it was an open question whether the places in which the
German troops contracted the disease were already infected
beforehand, or whether the disease had been brought there
for the first time by infected divisions of the French army.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the German field-army, 38,975 men, all told, contracted
dysentery (47·8 per 1,000 of the average number of troops
under arms), and of these 2,405 died. Of the average number
of French prisoners taken to Germany 41·7 per cent contracted
the disease; nearly all the cases of the disease were among
the prisoners themselves, who brought the germ with them,
and the result was that the number of cases soon began to
decrease. It was, of course, inevitable that numerous prison-guards
should contract the disease, but nowhere did it
spread in a serious way to the civil population.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of very great importance, as far as the war operations were
concerned, was the fact that typhus fever, which in former
years had played such a fatal rôle, did not make its appearance
among the troops; according to most observers, the disease
did not break out at all during the war. The Prussian
troops along the Russian border were never entirely free from
typhus fever; according to the German Health Report,
91 soldiers contracted the disease in the year 1867, 99 in
the year 1868, and 37 in the year 1869. France itself had
apparently been free from the disease for a long time, but
there was always a possibility that it would be conveyed into
the country from Algiers, where in the year 1868 a severe
epidemic had raged in consequence of a great famine the year
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>before; of the army in Algiers the disease had carried away
252 men (3·94 per cent).<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c011'><sup>[246]</sup></a> Consequently both the Germans
and the French watched very carefully any outbreaks of
a disease involving symptoms of typhus fever. Cases of
a disease held by the authorities to be typhus fever were
reported from Nancy, Châlons-sur-Marne, Lunéville, and
Metz, but careful investigations by von Niemeyer indicate
that they were merely cases of typhoid fever exhibiting
unusually well developed roseola. Several French physicians
(Chauffard, Léon Colin, Kelsch) likewise testify to the fact
that typhus fever did not appear in the French army during
the entire war. Grellois, to be sure, asserts that typhus fever
broke out about the middle of the siege of Metz and then
suddenly disappeared. But even this assertion may fairly
be questioned; at all events there was not a single soldier
in the garrison suffering from the disease at the time of the
capitulation, as Grellois himself admits.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to Michaux,<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c011'><sup>[247]</sup></a> a former chairman of the Medical
Society in Metz, a small epidemic of typhus fever raged
among the civil inhabitants of that city during the siege.
The correctness of this statement, however, is doubted, as
no post-mortem examinations were made. It seems that
fifty-five children and nine nurses in two orphan asylums
contracted the disease, and that twenty-eight of the former
and one of the latter succumbed to it; the first cases of the
disease were reported early in October, and by the end of
November the epidemic was over. This sudden disappearance
of the disease was attributed by Michaux to the termination
of the siege, a conclusion also upheld by Méry, who studied
the disease in the Crimean War. Viry,<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c011'><sup>[248]</sup></a> who until a few days
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>before the siege had charge of the field hospital in Vallières
(near Metz), where he treated some 250–300 patients every
day, performed autopsies on all supposed victims of typhus
fever, but in all cases found only the evidences of typhoid
fever. Nevertheless, he believes it possible that typhus
fever occurred there, and holds the view that the overcrowded
condition of the city favoured a spontaneous
outbreak of the disease. Laveran,<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c011'><sup>[249]</sup></a> who was also present in
Metz during the siege, disputes the correctness of Michaux’s
diagnosis, as does the German Health Report, on the ground
that the disease attacked children almost exclusively, that
it caused such a high mortality, and that it disappeared so
suddenly. He seems to think that it was some acute
exanthema, probably haemorrhagic measles. This leaves
unexplained the fact that a large number of nurses contracted
the disease.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>III. The Great Epidemic of Small-pox caused by the Franco-German War</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>But while typhoid fever and dysentery in the Franco-German
War attacked the civil population only in those
parts of the country in which the fighting took place, and
nowhere acquired epidemic dimensions, and while it is
probable that typhus fever did not appear at all at that time,
there occurred in connexion with the war a very severe
epidemic of small-pox, which raged more extensively and
furiously than any other epidemic in the course of the
entire century, and spread not only throughout the belligerent
countries, but also throughout all Europe.</p>

<p class='c007'>Everybody knows how severely Europe suffered from
epidemics of small-pox in the last part of the eighteenth
and first part of the nineteenth centuries, and how the ravages
of that disease were first checked by Jenner’s wonderful
discovery. Nevertheless, small-pox did not entirely disappear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>from Central Europe until the year 1870. The reason for
this is found in the fact that compulsory vaccination was
introduced in only a few states, and even in them was not
properly enforced, and also in the fact that people did not
until later begin to realize that vaccination insures immunity
only for a period of 12–15 years at most. Consequently new
recruits, if they had already been vaccinated once, were not
revaccinated when they began to serve. But since sporadic
outbreaks of small-pox continued to occur in the Prussian
army, orders were issued in the year 1834 that all recruits
must be vaccinated. The result was that from that time on,
the Prussian troops were very rarely attacked by the disease.
The same measure was adopted in Württemberg in 1833, in
Baden in 1840, in Bavaria in 1843, in Brunswick in 1858, in
the Kingdom of Saxony in 1868, and in the Grand Duchy of
Hesse in 1869. Compulsory vaccination did not exist in
Prussia or Saxony before the Imperial Vaccination Law was
passed in the year 1874; the result was that large numbers
of children were never vaccinated. The anti-vaccinationists,
especially in the ‘sixties, carried on a vigorous agitation, and
this had the effect of increasing the number of unvaccinated
persons; the number of revaccinated persons had always
been small. In South Germany compulsory vaccination for
one-year-old children was introduced in the first part of the
nineteenth century—in Bavaria and Hesse in 1807, in Baden
in 1815, in Württemberg in 1818—but revaccination was
not enforced until 1874, when the Imperial Vaccination Law
was passed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The small-pox mortality in Prussia prior to the year 1870
is indicated by the following table, which shows the number
of deaths per 10,000 inhabitants:</p>

1868 the disease began to abate, so that by the middle of
the year 1870 almost all of Prussia was free from small-pox,
as will be set forth in greater detail later on. In South
Germany the small-pox mortality was even lower; in Bavaria
it was 0·85 in the years 1861–70, in Württemberg it was 0·9 in

<p class='c007'>Vacher says in regard to these figures: ‘As far as the
actual number of persons who contracted and succumbed
to small-pox are concerned, they express only a small part
of the truth. The reports submitted to the Academy of
Medicine are rarely complete; it is even necessary to say
that about one-quarter of the Departments never send
in reports on the epidemics at all, although the ministerial
instructions render the submission of these reports obligatory,
and although the Academy never ceases to protest against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>the negligence of the prefectoral administrators.’ Vacher
then goes on to say that in the years 1860–9 only 59 out of
every 100 infants born were vaccinated, and that at the
outbreak of the war about one-third of the French population
was unvaccinated; in many Departments, indeed, as many
as four-fifths (Aveyron, Corsica, &amp;c.). Small-pox was much
more prevalent in the French army than in the German
army; according to the German Health Report,<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c011'><sup>[252]</sup></a> the number

<p class='c007'>The reason for this lies in the fact that a larger proportion
of the Prussian soldiers were vaccinated. Since the year
1806 all French recruits who had never been vaccinated were
supposed to submit to the inoculation when they presented
themselves for service, but this regulation was for years
at a time very laxly enforced; consequently in the year
1857 a new order was issued, introducing compulsory
vaccination for all recruits. But even this order does not
seem to have been everywhere carried out with the necessary
strictness, and complaints regarding the partial success of
vaccination were frequently made by military physicians.</p>

<p class='c007'>As stated above, there was a noticeable increase in the
small-pox mortality in the year 1869; this increase lasted
into the beginning of the year 1870, but was confined to
certain localities. Chauffard’s<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c011'><sup>[253]</sup></a> report on epidemic diseases
in France is more incomplete for the years 1869–70, on
account of the war, than for previous years; it was supplemented,
partially at least, by the later reports of Vernois<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c011'><sup>[254]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>for the year 1871, and also by the comprehensive report of
M. Delpech<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c011'><sup>[255]</sup></a> for the years 1870–2. According to these,
epidemics of small-pox occurred in the year 1869 in North-west
France (Bretagne), in North-east France (Departments
of Aisne, Pas-de-Calais), and in South-east France (Departments
of Gers, Ariège, and Pyrénées-Orientales.) In the
winter of 1869–70 the epidemic continued to spread, and by
the end of the year 1870 it included almost the whole of
France. The incomplete reports give us no idea as to which
Departments were attacked before the outbreak of the war
and which after. According to Vernois, the disease appeared
that year in 42 Departments, including 132 arrondissements
and 539 parishes. But, as stated above, the reports are all
very incomplete; a later report submitted by Delpech adds
11 more Departments to the 42. The total number of
deaths caused by small-pox in France in the year 1871 is
unknown; Vernois reported 14,425 deaths in 39 Departments,
but this does not include the figures for Paris, where 10,539
persons succumbed to the disease, or for the Department of
Finistère, or for the Department of Sarthe (in regard to
which it is merely observed that there were ‘beaucoup de
morts’), or for several other Departments.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a fact that small-pox raged severely among the civil
inhabitants of all regions in which the second half of the
war was waged (to the south, east, and north of Paris), and
that the war itself helped the disease to spread in the eastern
Departments (Jura, Doubs, Saône-et-Loire, Haute-Saône).
The wide prevalence of the disease among the soldiers is
attributed by many French physicians to the fact that the
army as a whole had been inadequately vaccinated. If this
was true of the regular troops, lack of time made it absolutely
impossible to vaccinate all the men that were afterwards
assembled in such a precipitate manner. The movements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>of the soldiers in the cold season of the year (in December there
was some bitterly cold weather) made it necessary for friends
and enemies to share whatever shelter they could find, regardless
of whether the house had previously been occupied by
small-pox patients, or whether such patients were actually
lying in it at the time. The result was that the disease became
very widespread throughout all France. Says Laveran:<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c011'><sup>[256]</sup></a>
‘The army, being composed of men who had been in service
for a long time, and who had been vaccinated and revaccinated,
suffered very little, but the events which took place after
the declaration of war altered this state of affairs. The
regiments of the Departments on their way to Paris were
quartered in the homes of civilians, where they contracted
small-pox. The disease spread easily among the young people
who, owing to lack of time, had not been revaccinated, and
many of whom had perhaps never been vaccinated at all.
During the first part of the siege of Paris it was these
regiments which suffered the most from small-pox, but
later on the epidemic became more general and spread to
all the corps. The number of soldiers infected with small-pox
during the siege was about 6·76 per 100, or 68 per
1,000.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Small-pox raged very extensively in besieged strongholds.
In Paris an epidemic of small-pox began in
November 1869, and the number of deaths caused by the
disease there was:<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c011'><sup>[257]</sup></a></p>

revaccinated for lack of time, and many of whom had never
been vaccinated at all. A severe epidemic now began to

small-pox patients in the garrison were housed, and where

<p class='c007'>The disease raged very extensively in the French provincial
armies that were organized to relieve Paris—thus in the
south-western, northern, and south-eastern scenes of the war,
small-pox had already made its appearance among the civil
inhabitants of those parts of the country in consequence
of the continual passing through of soldiers, many of whom
had never been vaccinated. Orléans, Chartres, and Le Mans,
were the main centres of the pestilence; in the north
Amiens, Bois-Guillaume, Rouen, and other places; in the
south, besides the strongholds of Belfort and Langres, the
cities of Dijon, Besançon, Pontarlier, and several other places.
The disease raged furiously throughout this entire region,
but the exact number of deaths is not known.</p>

<p class='c007'>In south-eastern France, small-pox did not become very
widespread until after the outbreak of the war; in Lyons,
for example, the epidemic began in the second half of
October. To be sure, small-pox had appeared in several
places in the year 1868, but by the winter of 1868–9 this
epidemic was over, although individual cases continued to
occur. Regarding the cause of the small-pox epidemic that
broke out in Lyons in the autumn of 1870, Fonteret<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c011'><sup>[260]</sup></a> gives
us the following information: ‘Two causes could not help
favouring the outbreak in our city; the movements of the
troops that took place at that time, and the emigration of
numerous Parisians, who since the beginning of September,
that is to say, since the time when the epidemic began to
rage furiously in Paris, passed through our city on their way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>to Switzerland.’ Regarding the course of the epidemic, no
statistics covering the entire city are available, but we are
able to see from the following table, compiled by Perroud,
the number of small-pox patients taken in by the Hôtel-Dieu
and the number that died there:</p>

<p class='c007'>In the other cantons of the Department 935 deaths were
officially recorded in the years 1870–1. It was observed in
Lyons, as in other places, that not only the number of
persons who contracted small-pox, but also the virulence
of the disease itself, increased; whereas only 10.6 per cent
of 227 sporadic cases resulted fatally between January and
September, out of 1,004 persons who contracted the disease
between October 1870 and July 1871 no less than 21.7
per cent died.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the year 1871 small-pox did not spare a single Department
in France, although many of them failed to send in
reports. Vacher estimates the number of deaths due to the
disease in the year 1871 at 58,236, but he adds that the
estimate is too small. No report, for example, was sent in
by the Department of Sarthe, where in the city of Le Mans
alone there were 1,181 deaths, nor by the Department of
Haute-Garonne, where there were 1,328 deaths in Toulouse.
The total number of unreported deaths, therefore, must have
been at least 20,000. It is almost impossible to estimate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>the number of deaths that occurred in the year 1870. From
the available statistics Vacher estimates the number of
deaths caused by the disease in the two years 1870–1 at
89,954, a figure, as he himself says, ‘which represents only
a part of the reality.’ Another estimate made by Vacher,
putting the number of deaths caused by small-pox in the
years 1869–70 at 200,000, is in all probability not an
exaggeration.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the year 1872, to be sure, small-pox appeared in the form
of epidemics in numerous parts of France, but nowhere did
it spread so widely as in the two previous years. According
to a report worked out by Delpech for the years 1870–2, no
less than 42 Departments failed to make any report at all
in the year 1872, while only 18 of the remaining 41 Departments
sent in reports regarding epidemic outbreaks of small-pox.
The epidemic lasted until 1873, in which year reports
regarding small-pox epidemics came in from 10 Departments;
but only in the Departments of Morbihan and Pyrénées-Orientales
was the epidemic apparently somewhat more
intense.<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c011'><sup>[261]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'>2. <em>Small-pox among the French Prisoners</em></h4>

<p class='c013'>Thanks to the well-vaccinated condition of the German
troops, the army suffered comparatively little from small-pox.
In the field army 4,385 men (61·3 per 1,000) contracted the
disease, and 278 of them (3·5 per cent of those who contracted
it) died. Including the officers, physicians, and officials,
the number taken sick was 4,991 and the number that died
was 297. The number of men in the individual army
corps that contracted the disease varied greatly according
to the nature and place of their activity; particularly hard
hit were the army divisions in the south-western and northern
scenes of the war, where the military operations were carried
on in fearfully cold weather, and where it was impossible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>to quarter the infected soldiers in isolated places by themselves.
The French army was attacked much more severely
by small-pox, although there are no accurate reports available
regarding the prevalence of the disease. According to
a report found in the <cite>Vienna Medical Weekly</cite>,<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c011'><sup>[262]</sup></a> the total
number of French soldiers that succumbed to small-pox was
23,469<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c011'><sup>[263]</sup></a>; but the accuracy of this number, to be sure, is
questionable, since, assuming that there was a very high
mortality, it would mean that some 120,000 troops contracted
the disease. At all events, the French army, taken as a whole,
was badly infected with small-pox, and it was inevitable
that among the French prisoners brought to Germany there
should be numerous small-pox patients, some in the incubation
stage, and some in the convalescent stage of the disease,
and that they should infect other people there.</p>

<p class='c007'>The number of French prisoners taken to Germany in
the first few months of the year 1871 was no less than 372,918;
the prisoners who at the very beginning, but especially
after the surrender of Metz, were transported in large
numbers to Germany, had to be distributed throughout the
entire Empire, clear over to the eastern boundary. Owing
to the fact that new transports of French prisoners were
constantly arriving at the German frontier, which, in consequence
of severe hardships and privations, they reached in
such a weak physical condition that they could not be taken
very far inland, it became necessary to transfer some of
the earlier arrivals to other places of detention, and this,
of course, favoured the further dissemination of the disease.
This transference was rendered particularly necessary by
the arrival of large numbers of prisoners after the battle
of Sedan (September 1), after the capitulation of Metz
(October 27), and after the battles of Orléans and Le Mans
(December and January respectively). Small-pox occasionally
broke out among these prisoners while they were on their
way to Germany, rendering it necessary to leave them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>behind, or else the disease made its appearance when they
reached their destination; as a rule, however, the first cases
of the disease were observed a few days after their arrival
at their place of detention, where they soon infected the
other prisoners. The further dissemination of the disease
among them was checked by means of wholesale vaccination.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the prisoners, 14,178, all told (38 per cent of the total
number taken), contracted small-pox, and of these 1,963
(5·26 per cent) died. The statistics in the German Health
Report indicate distinctly the number of prisoners in the
various states and provinces that contracted and succumbed
to the disease; but the total number of prisoners taken is
known only in the case of the larger states in the Confederation,
since the statistics in the Report are compiled on the
basis of the army-corps districts, which do not coincide with
the political divisions. The figures for the larger states are
as follows:</p>

German States no figures for the individual places are

prison-dépôts, Glogau, Magdeburg, Torgau, Wesel, Stettin, and
Mayence had the most cases of the disease; generally speaking,
the smaller places were less severely attacked, although
there are a few exceptions to this statement; in Stralsund,

<p class='c013'>The occurrence of small-pox in the immobile German army
was closely related to its prevalence among the prisoners,
and it attacked the immobile troops much more severely
than the field-troops. The latter, to be sure, were no less
exposed to the infection, but the former, taken as a whole,
were not nearly so well vaccinated; for it was impossible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>in the short time available to see to it that all the reserves
were vaccinated, since the troops designated for the field
were given the precedence. Thus between conscription and
vaccination there was more or less of an interval, during
which a large number of the reserves were not protected
against the disease. The total number of men in the immobile
army that contracted small-pox was 3,472 (excluding
Baden and the Grand Duchy of Hesse, regarding which we
have no statistics). Assuming that the average number of
reserves in the immobile army was 300,424, this means that
about 11·6 per 1,000 contracted the disease. The number
of cases among the immobile troops in the individual states

<p class='c007'>The number of French prisoners taken to Germany in the
month of July 1870 was small. Of the sixteen immobiles
who contracted the disease during that month, nine belonged
to the Ninth Army Corps, most of them having been infected
inland before the outbreak of the war. That the month of
July did not constitute the starting-point of the subsequent
epidemic is evident from the fact that the prevalence of the
disease decreased in August, as well as from countless
individual observations.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>4. <em>The Epidemic of Small-pox in the Civil Population of Germany in 1871–2</em></h4>

<p class='c013'>In the summer of 1870 Germany was almost free from
small-pox. Later on, thousands of French prisoners, almost
all of them hailing from infected localities, were within
a short time scattered throughout the entire German Empire,
and since the inhabitants of many parts of the country, as
stated above, were very insufficiently vaccinated, it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>inevitable that epidemics of small-pox should break out
everywhere. The disease was disseminated in several ways:
by prisoners who had contracted it on their way to Germany,
or who had to be transported from an infected to an uninfected
locality, by persons into whose systems the infection
had entered but had not yet revealed its presence, and by
uninfected persons who had come in contact with infected
persons; numerous persons, moreover, contracted the
disease by handling the clothing, blankets, and other effects
of small-pox patients.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The dissemination of the disease,’ says the German
Health Report,<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c011'><sup>[264]</sup></a> ‘which broke out simultaneously in various
parts of Germany, was helped along in numerous ways.
From the lazarets and from the prisons it was communicated
by nurses and guards, and by working men and tradesmen,
to the civil population and to the local garrison, and
from there it spread to the surrounding country. It was
conveyed from place to place, often considerable distances,
by the moving population itself, not infrequently by marching
troops, and particularly by the removal of prisoners from
one place of detention to another; the latter measure had
to be adopted in order to make room for the fresh transports
of prisoners that were constantly arriving, many of them
in such an exhausted condition that it was necessary to
spare them the long and trying journey to the far East.
Thus the prisons at Mayence, Coblenz, Wesel, Minden,
&amp;c. became the foci from which the disease was transplanted
into hitherto uninfected places.’</p>

<p class='c007'>The result was that there broke out in Germany an
epidemic of small-pox which raged more furiously and
extensively than any other epidemic in the course of the nineteenth
century. Whereas among the prisoners-of-war and
among the immobile German troops (who were particularly
exposed to the infection) the disease reached its climax as
early as January 1871, among the civil inhabitants of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>country this climax did not come until later in the year;
in the more out-of-the-way regions, moreover, where there
was less intercourse, the height of the epidemic was not
reached until the year 1872.</p>

<h5 class='c014'><em>(a) The Dissemination of Small-pox in Prussia and in the smaller North German States</em></h5>

<p class='c013'>After the prevalence of small-pox in Prussia had again
increased somewhat in the years 1864–7, in the following
years the number of cases of the disease grew steadily smaller,
so that around the middle of the year 1870 the country was
practically free from it. Its prevalence again increased in
the first months of the year 1871. The following table indicates
the number of deaths caused by the disease in Prussia

<p class='c007'>In the year 1874 only one person per 10,000 inhabitants
succumbed to the disease. Among the French prisoners
small-pox usually broke out very soon after their arrival
at their place of detention, while among the inhabitants of
the places in which the prisons were located it usually did
not make its appearance until several months later. Guttstadt,<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c011'><sup>[266]</sup></a>
in his excellent work on the <em>Epidemic of Small-pox
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>in Prussia in the Years 1870–1</em>, has compiled a table of
statistics indicating in a number of places when the disease
first made its appearance among the prisoners and among
the civil inhabitants. We reproduce this table below, with
a few small alterations. In some of the places mentioned
there was no military prison; only prisoners suffering from
small-pox were taken to them, usually resulting in an epidemic
of the disease among the civil inhabitants. The table clearly
indicates the connexion between the small-pox epidemics
among the civil inhabitants and the outbreaks of the disease
among the prisoners; regarding the manner of dissemination
in the case of the individual epidemics we shall have more
to say further on.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>The small-pox mortality varied greatly in the different
Prussian Governmental Districts; particularly noteworthy
is the fact that it was considerably higher in the eastern
provinces, especially in the year 1872, than in the western
provinces, notwithstanding the fact that the latter were
exposed to the infection much sooner and much more frequently
in consequence of the arrival and passing through
of French prisoners. The only plausible explanation of this
is the fact that the inhabitants of eastern Prussia were
not so thoroughly vaccinated as those in the west; this,
however, was not because the anti-vaccinationists were more
influential in the east, but because the eastern provinces
had fewer physicians than the western provinces, where
medical advice and help were far more accessible, and where
the population was more enlightened. The effect of vaccination
is clearly revealed in those Governmental Districts
in the west which introduced compulsory vaccination before
they were incorporated into Prussia; Schleswig-Holstein
did this in 1811, Hanover in 1821, the Governmental District
of Wiesbaden in 1820, and the Governmental District
of Cassel in 1828. All these parts of the country had fewer
cases of small-pox. The Governmental Districts in which
large military prisons were located, and those in which,
owing to a higher industrial development, there was more
intercourse of all kinds, were attacked earlier by small-pox
than the others. Of the western provinces only the two
highly industrial districts of Arnsberg and Düsseldorf, and
the district of Trèves, were very severely attacked. The living
conditions among the working people were not so good at
that time as they are to-day, and the close quarters must
necessarily have favoured the dissemination of small-pox;
furthermore, the constant moving about of the working
inhabitants, many of whom did not live where they were
employed, helped to spread it. Thus it was observed in the
vicinity of Leipzig, that the villages inhabited by working
people were much more severely attacked by small-pox than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>those inhabited by farmers, with their stationary and settled
population. The high figures in the case of the Governmental
District of Trèves may be explained by the fact that its location
made it necessary for a large proportion of the French
prisoners that were taken into Prussia to pass through it.
The number of deaths per 10,000 inhabitants in the various
Governmental Districts of Prussia is indicated by the following
table (the districts which introduced compulsory
vaccination in the year 1870 are designated with an asterisk):</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>In East Prussia small-pox broke out very frequently in
the city and vicinity of Königsberg. According to Guttstadt,
small-pox patients, in consequence of the proximity
of the Russian border, kept coming to the hospital in Königsberg,
into which twelve persons suffering from the disease
were received between January 1 and August 1, 1870. The
first prisoners-of-war arrived at Königsberg on August 15,
1870, and among them was a small-pox patient. Shortly
afterwards two more cases of the disease occurred among
the prisoners. The first case among the civil population
occurred in the hospital on September 2. Owing to the
constant intercourse between the prisoners and the civil
inhabitants the epidemic spread very rapidly. The districts
surrounding Königsberg were very severely attacked in the
year 1871, while the more remote districts, especially those
along the boundary of West Prussia, were not attacked until
the year 1872. In the districts around Königsberg the
mortality per 10,000 inhabitants was as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>Several of the last fifteen districts (Heydekrug to Johannisburg
in the above table) had relatively few cases of small-pox;
the reason for this was that the governmental district
of Gumbinnen had but little intercourse, that few prisoners
were taken there at all, and that there were no cases of
small-pox among the few that were taken there.</p>

<p class='c007'>Danzig was the chief seat of the pestilence in West Prussia,
since large numbers of prisoners were confined there; per
10,000 inhabitants 79·6 succumbed to small-pox in the year
1871, and 35·9 in the year 1872. Says Liévin:<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c011'><sup>[267]</sup></a> ‘For
a considerable length of time no cases of small-pox occurred
in Danzig, but in the month of September 1870 the
beginnings of an epidemic were observed. Although this
happened shortly after the arrival of the first prisoners,
nevertheless the beginning of the epidemic was probably not
connected in any causal way with this circumstance. For,
in the first place, the prisoners were French soldiers captured
in the battles of Weissenburg and Wörth, and were in all
probability healthy men, judging from the fact that not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>a single case of the disease occurred among them in the first
few months; in the second place, the disease broke out
very sporadically in the first three or four months, individual
outbreaks occurring here and there in the city, just as has
been the case in Danzig almost every year. But during
this indigenous pestilence a large number of badly infected
prisoners arrived from the Metz garrison; this gave rise to
an epidemic which, had the prisoners not arrived, would
probably have progressed in the usual, scarcely noticeable
manner; as it was, however, the epidemic attained to the
largest dimensions known to the memory of man.’</p>

<p class='c007'>According to Liévin, the total number of small-pox cases
in Danzig and its suburbs (including the garrison and the
prisoners-of-war) was:</p>

appeared on September 16; the maximum number of
prisoners there was 13,621, and of these 1,198 contracted
the disease. The first case among the civil inhabitants was
reported on October 7; in December the disease was conveyed
to the surrounding villages, especially by tradespeople
who had visited the markets in Glogau. The adjacent
districts suffered relatively little in the year 1871. In the
governmental district of Liegnitz, with the exception of
Glogau, where there were 31·2 deaths per 10,000 inhabitants,
only Görlitz and Liegnitz had high figures in the year 1871.
In the city of Görlitz a prisoner was committed to the
lazaret in November 1870, and in December, when a transport
of prisoners passed through the city, one of them was
left behind there; the epidemic among the civil inhabitants
began in January 1871. Again in the year 1872 small-pox did
not become very widespread except in the districts of Liegnitz,
Jauer, Hirschberg, and Görlitz; Liegnitz, with a mortality
of 35·2 per 10,000 inhabitants, had the highest figures.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Governmental District of Breslau cases of small-pox
were frequently reported. In the city of Breslau the first case
among the prisoners occurred on November 11, the second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>on January 27, the third and fourth in April and May, 1871;
the first cases in the garrison likewise occurred in November;

larger. The number of reported cases in the city was:<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c011'><sup>[269]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The epidemic was very severe. Whereas during the previous
epidemics (1856–7, 1863–4, and 1868–9) only about seven per
cent of the patients treated in the hospital died, in 1871–2 no
less than 322 out of 2,416 patients (13·4 per cent) taken there
were carried away by the disease. Of the 322 patients, moreover,
182 had hemorrhagic small-pox, and of these 166 died.</p>

<p class='c007'>The immediate vicinity of Breslau was very severely
attacked; in the districts lying to the south of the Oder
small-pox raged extensively in the year 1871, whereas those
districts on the north side of the river did not suffer very
severely until the year 1872. This may be explained by the
fact that the extensive industrial activity of the districts
south-west of the Oder rendered considerable intercourse
with Breslau necessary. The following table indicates the
number of deaths per 10,000 inhabitants in the districts
north-east of the Oder:</p>

<p class='c007'>In Upper Silesia the stronghold of Neisse had a maximum
number of 12,801 prisoners, among whom there were 385
cases of small-pox and 117 deaths; in the garrison, which
averaged 4,452 men, there were 39 cases and 1 death. The
first cases among the prisoners were reported on September 25,
and in the garrison in November. The civil inhabitants
suffered very little in the year 1871, and the number of
deaths among them did not begin to grow large until 1872.
Only in the district of Neisse and in the neighbouring district
of Grottkau was the number of deaths larger in 1871 than in
1872; in all the other districts there were more deaths
in 1872. The districts which were most severely attacked
in the year 1872 were—Kreuzburg (78·2 deaths per 10,000
inhabitants), Posenberg (58·6), Gross-Strelitz (60·0), Beuthen
(56·5), and Kosel (62·4).</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Province of Pomerania the city of Stettin came to
be a general rendezvous for prisoners of war; the maximum
number of them, owing to the continual arrival of new
transports, was no less than 21,000. The first transport
arrived on August 12, and the first small-pox patient among
them was committed to the hospital on August 28. Of the
prisoners, 1,303 contracted the disease and 194 succumbed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>to it. The climax of the epidemic came in January, when
there were 462 cases reported. The first cases in the garrison,
which averaged 7,000 men, occurred in October, the first
man to contract the disease being a sick-attendant, and the
second an artilleryman; after that, all the branches of
service were attacked. The epidemic in the garrison,
however, was confined to 74 men, only 5 of whom died. In
December the disease spread to the civil population; the
number of cases (including the garrison) was 422 (55·5 per
10,000) in the year 1871, and 113 (14·8 per 10,000) in the
following year. In the Governmental District of Stettin only
the communities surrounding the city of Stettin had high
small-pox figures in the year 1871, and these communities
were also more severely attacked in the year 1872. The
following table indicates the number of deaths per 10,000
inhabitants in the communities mentioned:</p>

<p class='c007'>At the stronghold of Kolberg (Governmental District of
Köslin) 3,500 prisoners arrived on November 4, and in
December and January they were followed by the arrival
of more transports. The first cases among these prisoners
were reported on November 14; all told, 175 of them
contracted small-pox and 24 succumbed to it. On January 7
the disease spread to the civil population, but did not rage
very extensively in the city; 127 civilians contracted it
and 24 succumbed to it, and in August 1871 it disappeared;
only two men in the garrison were taken sick. Many of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>the prisoners in Kolberg were transported to Stettin, Köslin,
and Stolp, and in all three of these places the disease broke
out among the civil inhabitants. In Schivelbein an infected
soldier was found among the prisoners who arrived on
January 24, 1871, and on January 26 he was committed to
the lazaret; in February a working-man contracted the disease
in the same lazaret, and after that the epidemic spread
throughout the city and did not disappear until October 1872;
it carried away a relatively large number of people and spread
to two neighbouring villages. But taking the Governmental
District of Köslin as a whole, it may be said that the
dissemination of small-pox was moderate; the district of
Schlawe had the largest number of deaths (22·7 per 10,000
inhabitants). On the other hand, in the year 1872 small-pox
caused a very large number of deaths in the districts of
Neustettin, Dramburg, Schlawe, Rummelsburg, and Stolp.</p>

<p class='c007'>The number of cases of the disease in the Governmental
District of Stralsund was very large. Small-pox broke out
very severely among the French prisoners in the city of
Stralsund, the maximum number of whom was 2,991; of
these 234 contracted the disease and 35 succumbed to it.
The prisoners arrived on December 4, and among them was
a small-pox patient; he was committed to the lazaret on
December 9. In the garrison, which averaged 3,700 men,
there were only thirty-one cases of the disease and one
death. The first case among the civil inhabitants occurred
on January 7; the patient was a clerk who lived near the
lazaret and had had more or less intercourse with the
prisoners. Of twenty-three more cases that occurred before
January 15, at least six were shown to be directly attributable
to the epidemic among the prisoners; one of the six was
a sick-attendant, two were working-men in the military
lazaret, and the other three were members of the families
of attendants. The epidemic then became very widespread;
to the end of the year 1871 the number of deaths was 366,
and the number of reported cases was 1,807. In Greifswald
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>a French prisoner contracted small-pox on October 18, 1870,
in the military reserve lazaret, another on November 1, and
a third on November 16. The first civilian, an attendant,
contracted the disease on December 13, and on January 6,
1871, a working-man, who had transported the attendant
from the military lazaret to the town small-pox hospital,
was taken sick. Until February 14, ten more cases were
reported, and then the epidemic began. Up to the end of
the year 1871 no less than 578 cases of the disease and 111
deaths caused by it were reported to the authorities. In the
year 1872 there were only a few deaths caused by small-pox
throughout the entire Governmental District of Stralsund.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of the two adjacent confederate states of
Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz no small-pox
mortality statistics are available. On September 20,
prisoners from Metz were taken to the reserve lazaret in
Schwerin, and among them was a small-pox patient who
died eight days later. In the same month an assistant in
the lazaret was taken sick, and in October and December
two more members of the lazaret staff contracted the disease.
The pestilence spread to the civil population because the
attendants who were commissioned to dispose of the effects
of the dead, instead of destroying them, sold or gave them
to the inhabitants. The epidemic, which spread rapidly
throughout the surrounding country, was quite severe and
lasted until March 1871. In Wismar two cases of small-pox
were reported among the prisoners in December, and these
were followed by six more cases in January and February;
in the garrison, which averaged 1,219 men, there were 48
cases of the disease (5 in January, 32 in February, 9 in March,
and 2 in April); 3 of the 48 were fatal. At Rostock 649
prisoners arrived on November 11, and these were followed
by 544 more on December 14; among the latter there were
two small-pox patients, and in the course of the next few
months forty-one more cases of the disease and six deaths
were reported.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>Berlin suffered severely from an epidemic of small-pox in
the years 1871–2. The last large epidemic there had occurred
in the year 1801, and had carried away 1,626 out of 176,700
inhabitants. In the year 1864 another rather mild epidemic
had broken out, but had quickly disappeared. In the year
1870 the number of small-pox patients in Berlin was small;
an average of nine persons per month succumbed to the
disease between the first part of August and the last part
of November. In the month of December 1870 the death-rate
began to increase, at first rather slowly; the number
of deaths in that month was 22, and in March 1872 it was
176. The epidemic now began to spread rapidly, and in
June it reached its climax with 648 deaths; during the
summer it abated a little, but in the fall it began to rage
more and more furiously until December, when it reached
a second climax with 671 deaths. The progress of the
epidemic is shown by the following table, taken from
Guttstadt’s excellent book. The number of deaths caused
by small-pox in Berlin was:</p>

of the city was 826,341, was 5,212, or 63·1 per 10,000 inhabitants;
thus the total mortality, which in the years 1867–70
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>had been 31·8 per cent (including the still-births), reached
the prodigious height of 40·4 per cent. The cause of the
wide dissemination of small-pox in Berlin was the fact
that large numbers of people, including children, had never
been vaccinated, and only a few had ever been revaccinated.
According to a rough estimate made by Guttstadt, of
Berlin’s total population in the year 1871 some 20,000 people
had never been vaccinated, 530,000 had been vaccinated
only once, and only 270,000 had been revaccinated; fourteen
per cent of those who had never been vaccinated, two per
cent of those who had been vaccinated once, and O·5 per cent
of those who had been revaccinated, contracted the disease.
In the garrison, which averaged 9,110 men, only 57 cases of
the disease and 4 deaths were reported between July 1, 1870,
and June 30, 1871. But few prisoners were taken to Berlin;
only 24 prisoners suffering from small-pox were committed
to the lazarets, and of these only 4 died; the first two cases
were in August and September.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Governmental District of Potsdam only those
districts which bordered directly on Berlin were severely
attacked by small-pox in the year 1871, e.g. the districts
of Niederbarnim, Teltow, Jüterbog, Luckenwalde, and East
and West Havelland; in the following years those districts
bordering on Niederbarnim (as Oberbarnim, Angermünde, and
Templin) also suffered severely. In the city of Potsdam two
Frenchmen contracted the disease on February 6, shortly
after their arrival there, and on February 19 a soldier who
had accompanied them was taken sick. In April an epidemic
of rather wide extent was raging in the city; the number of
deaths caused by small-pox in April 1871 was 157 (34·5
per 10,000 inhabitants), and in April 1872 it was 71 (16·2 per
10,000). In the city of Brandenburg-on-the-Havel an
infected French soldier arrived in February 1871; he
communicated the disease to his attendant, and in that
very month cases of small-pox were reported among the civil
inhabitants of the city, although it was impossible to prove
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>a connexion between them and that of the French soldier.
The number of deaths, all told, was 59. The number of
deaths per 10,000 inhabitants in the Governmental District
of Potsdam was:</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Governmental District of Frankfurt small-pox raged
only to a moderate extent in the year 1871. In Frankfurt-on-the-Oder
itself there were sporadic outbreaks of the disease
every year. On November 12 two infected prisoners from
Metz were committed to the hospital, and before the end of
that month two attendants contracted the disease; a few
cases also occurred in the garrison in the month of November.
Of the French prisoners, whose maximum number was 756,
eight contracted the disease and two succumbed to it; in the
garrison, which averaged 1,881 men, there were 21 cases of
the disease and no deaths. Among the civil inhabitants, on
the other hand, a somewhat more severe epidemic raged;
whereas in the year 1870 only 21 cases of the disease were
reported, in the year 1871 there were 19 cases in the month
of January alone; until May some 196 persons contracted
the disease, which after that began to abate. The number
of deaths, all told, in the year 1871 was 117, and in 1872 it
was 70. In Landsberg-on-the-Warthe small-pox broke out
in the middle of November in consequence of the arrival of
an infected prisoner; the first case among the civil inhabitants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>was reported on November 20. The total number of deaths
in the year 1871 was 97. At Kottbus an infected French
prisoner arrived on October 1, resulting in a rather severe
epidemic among the civil inhabitants (114 deaths in the year
1871). Not until the year 1872 did the disease become very
widespread in the Governmental District of Frankfurt; with
the exception of the city of Frankfurt there was no district
which suffered more severely in the year 1871 than in 1872.
In most of the districts small-pox broke out very virulently,
the only exceptions being the districts of Lübben and
Spremberg.</p>

<p class='c007'>Regarding the dissemination of small-pox in the Province
of Saxony Guttstadt gives us very detailed information.
In the years 1871–2 the disease was equally prevalent in
all three governmental districts in the Province. In the city
of Magdeburg the last case was reported on May 24, 1870, and
from then until November there was not a single case among
the civil inhabitants. The first prisoners arrived at Magdeburg
in the latter part of August, and on September 14 a case
of small-pox was observed among them; this was followed
by ten more cases in that month. Of the prisoners brought
to Magdeburg, the maximum number of whom was no less
than 25,450, some 1,092 contracted the disease, and of these
271 died. The largest number of cases was reported in the
month of February 1871. Of the garrison, which averaged
11,296 men, there were only 84 cases of the disease (7·4 per
cent), and of these 8 died. The first case among the civil
inhabitants was reported on November 18, 1870, and this
was followed by seven more cases in that month, occurring
in various parts of the city. The number of deaths in
the year 1871 was 646 (56·4 per 10,000 inhabitants), and
in the year 1872 only 45 deaths were reported. From the
city of Magdeburg small-pox spread to the surrounding
country.</p>

<p class='c007'>On November 25 a transport of prisoners from Metz, after
having been detained for two or three weeks in the badly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>infected city of Minden, arrived at Quedlinburg; two days
later the first case of small-pox occurred among them.
A second transport, which arrived on January 31, 1871,
likewise brought infected men with it. Among the civil
inhabitants small-pox did not become very widespread, and
only three civilians succumbed to the disease in the year
1871. In Aschersleben small-pox broke out among the
prisoners in January 1871, a few days after their arrival from
Mayence, and the number of cases reported in the months
of January and February was only twelve. According to
Guttstadt, small-pox was already prevalent in the civil
population in December, when the disease was given an
opportunity to spread to the surrounding country. According
to the German Health Report, on the other hand, small-pox
did not appear in the city until February, when the proprietor
of an inn, which had been converted into a small-pox
hospital, contracted it. The total number of deaths in the
year 1871 amounted to 53 (31·6 per 10,000 inhabitants).
On January 26 and 27, 1871, some 360 prisoners, four of
them infected with small-pox, arrived at Halberstadt, having
come from Mayence. The number of deaths in the city of
Halberstadt in the year 1871 was 29 (11·4 per 10,000 inhabitants).
Only those districts in the Governmental District of
Magdeburg which bordered on the city of Magdeburg were
more severely attacked; Kalbe (43·1 deaths per 10,000
inhabitants), Wanzleben (37·7), and Wollmirstedt (29·2). In
addition to these the district of Wernigerode also had a very
high small-pox mortality in the year 1871 (70·5 per 10,000).
In those districts further away from Magdeburg—Osterburg,
Salzwedel, Aschersleben, and Halberstadt—the climax of
the small-pox mortality was not reached until the year 1872,
whereas in the other districts it was reached in 1871.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Governmental District of Merseburg small-pox broke
out very severely in the stronghold of Torgau, where in the
last part of September and in the first part of December
prisoners arrived from Strassburg and Metz, respectively; in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>both transports, but especially in the second, there were
infected men. The first cases of the disease were reported
on October 4. Of the prisoners, the maximum number of
whom was 9,359, some 603 (64·4 per 1,000) contracted the
disease and 128 (21·2 per cent of those who contracted it)
died. The epidemic, accordingly, was unusually severe
among the prisoners, and it reached its climax in January.
In the German garrison, which averaged 3,943 men, there
were, all told, 75 cases of the disease (19·0 per 1,000) and five
deaths. Among the civil inhabitants the first persons to
contract the disease in the last part of November and first
part of December were a woman, who was employed as
a laundress in the garrison lazaret, her sons, and a woman
who had visited the place where the prisoners were confined.
The epidemic did not break out until December 22, on which
day a single case was reported; on the following day twelve
more cases were reported. The total number of deaths was
67 (61·7 per 10,000). Very soon the infection spread throughout
the entire vicinity of Torgau, which in the year 1871
had a very high small-pox mortality; by 1872 the disease
had almost disappeared from the city.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Wittenberg, which before the arrival of the prisoners
was absolutely free from small-pox, a transport arrived on
August 27, and on September 5 the first small-pox patients
were taken to the lazaret. Among the Frenchmen the disease
did not rage very extensively; of a maximum number of
9,753, only fifty-one (5·2 per cent) contracted the disease
and ten succumbed to it. Of the garrison, which averaged
2,845 men, seventeen contracted the disease and two died.
Among the civil inhabitants the first case of small-pox was
reported on October 3; it was that of a pastor who had
been serving as curate among the prisoners. This case was
followed by several others, most of the victims being persons
who lived in the vicinity of the pastor’s dwelling-place. The
pestilence then began to spread rapidly among the civil
inhabitants, finally developing into a severe epidemic. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>were 768 cases reported, distributed as indicated by the
following table:</p>

<p class='c020'>Of those who contracted the disease five died in the year
1870 and 100 died in the following year (86·5 per 10,000
inhabitants). Likewise in the country surrounding Wittenberg
small-pox was very widespread in the year 1871.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the French prisoners in Halle-on-the-Saale there
were twenty-eight cases of small-pox in January and
February, and at the same time a few cases of the disease
were reported in the regiment that was transferred from
Halle to Mülhausen. In the first part of March 1871, cases
were reported among the civil inhabitants, and they constituted
the beginning of a large epidemic. In the year 1871
there were 195 deaths due to the disease (37·0 per 10,000
inhabitants) and in the year 1872 there were forty-one
more deaths.</p>

<p class='c007'>Generally speaking, small-pox was rather uniformly spread
throughout the Governmental District of Merseburg in the
year 1871; the districts of Torgau and Wittenberg were
the only ones that were attacked with particular severity.
In the western part of the governmental district small-pox
raged more furiously in 1872 than in 1871.</p>

<p class='c007'>The city of Erfurt (Governmental District of Erfurt) in
the year 1869 had been the scene of a small-pox epidemic,
which lasted well into the following year. The last cases
of the disease occurring in connexion with this epidemic
were reported on August 13, 1870. To be sure, the disease
revealed its presence on September 27 and 30 among the
French prisoners, who had arrived on August 21, and these
cases were followed by many more when a new transport
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>of prisoners arrived from Metz; but of all the prisoners in
Erfurt, the maximum number of whom was no less than
12,400, only 203 men (16·4 per cent), all told, contracted the
disease, and of these only 28 died. In the garrison, which
averaged 4,627 men, there were 25 cases of small-pox and
no deaths. On the other hand, in December there began
among the civil inhabitants an epidemic which spread rapidly
and reached its climax in April 1871, with 244 cases. According
to Guttstadt, the number of deaths due to small-pox
was 253 (53·9 per 10,000 inhabitants) in the year 1871, and
33 in the year 1872. The epidemic did not come to an end
until June 1872.<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c011'><sup>[271]</sup></a> In Mülhausen, prisoners from Mayence,
where small-pox was prevalent, arrived in the first part of
December, and some of them were already infected with the
disease. On February 1 the pestilence spread to the civil
population, and carried away twenty-five persons in the
course of the entire year. Nordhausen was free from small-pox
in the summer of 1870; but the disease was twice borne
into the city, in October 1870 and in January 1871, by
prisoners. The first cases among the civil inhabitants were
reported in the latter month, after which they increased
rapidly in number. In the year 1870 there were 233 deaths
(109·5 per 10,000 inhabitants) due to the pestilence. Except
in these two cities of Erfurt and Nordhausen the disease did
not become very widespread in the year 1871 in any part
of the Governmental District of Erfurt.</p>

<p class='c007'>Regarding the appearance of small-pox in Brunswick, the
Thuringian States, and Anhalt, only a small amount of
information is available. In the city of Brunswick a German
soldier, who had come from Carignan, contracted the disease
in September, and in November and January six Frenchmen
were taken sick; two of the latter died. In the garrison,
which averaged 1,389 men, there were four cases of small-pox
in March and June. According to a manuscript report of the
Brunswick Bureau of Statistics, the number of deaths due
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>to small-pox throughout the entire Duchy was 2 in the
year 1870, 269 in the year 1871, and 215 in the year 1872.
At Gotha a French prisoner suffering from small-pox was
left behind in January, and another prisoner in the same
transport contracted the disease a few days later; in February
there were a few isolated cases in the garrison. At Weimar
a German field-soldier suffering from small-pox arrived in
February; he infected the woman who took care of him,
and presently the disease broke out in the city. In Altenburg
two infected sub-officers of the field-army and two
Frenchmen, likewise suffering from the disease, were committed
to the reserve-lazaret, and shortly afterwards a small
epidemic broke out in the garrison. There were ten cases
of the disease and no deaths among the Frenchmen, and in
the garrison, which averaged 1,178 men, there were eleven
cases and one death. Among the civil inhabitants the first
to be attacked were a sick-attendant and a journeyman
mason; the latter had removed the soot from a stove in
a room occupied by small-pox patients.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen, according to a manuscript
report of the local Bureau of Statistics, the number of deaths
due to small-pox in the years 1860–71 was 133, in the year
1872 it was 37, and in the year 1873 it was 47. The figures
for the several years before 1871 are not available. Every
transport of sick soldiers from France brought small-pox
patients to the city of Meiningen; five cases, the first in
January, were reported in the garrison, which consisted of
1,663 men, and in the same month there were cases among
the civil inhabitants. It was impossible, however, to establish
a connexion between those in the garrison and those in
the city.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Dessau, one French prisoner in October and two in
November contracted the disease, which in January appeared
throughout the city and became epidemic. In the garrison,
which consisted of 1,228 men, there were ten cases of the
disease, none of which terminated fatally.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>Hamburg,<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c011'><sup>[272]</sup></a> after the by no means mild epidemic that
raged there in the year 1864 (19·7 deaths per 10,000
inhabitants) suffered very little from the disease in the following
years; in 1868 there were five deaths reported, and
in 1869 the number increased to twenty. After the Franco-German
War an epidemic of small-pox raged in Hamburg,
which was more extensive and more furious than almost any
other epidemic that Germany had ever experienced. In the
years 1870–2 no less than 4,053 persons succumbed to small-pox
in Hamburg. Among the French prisoners there were
twenty-two cases of the disease and one death, and among
the German troops there were twelve cases and no deaths.
The disease first made its appearance in the summer of 1870,
when there were a few cases in the city; but in October
they began to increase in number, and by the first of the
year the disease was spreading rapidly. The number of
deaths in Hamburg was:</p>

<p class='c020'>The figures for 1870 and 1871 include the city and suburbs,
and those for 1872 the entire State—a fact, however, which
makes but little difference. This severe epidemic gave rise
to the passing of a law on January 30, 1872, rendering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>vaccination compulsory; the enforcement of this law was
greatly facilitated in the following years by the fact that
everybody very soon came to recognize the superiority of
animal lymph.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Schleswig-Holstein the city of Altona, which bordered
on Hamburg, was very severely attacked by small-pox.
No detailed information regarding the epidemic there is
available; the population of the city in the year 1871 was
83,177, and in the same year 965 persons (116·0 per 10,000
inhabitants) succumbed to small-pox; in the following year
there were only two deaths. In the year 1871 only three
districts were more severely attacked by the disease than
Altona—Rendsburg, Steinburg, and Stollmarn. The city
of Rendsburg was an important seat of the disease, which
broke out there on November 16 among the prisoners,
shortly after their arrival; the epidemic, however, was
rather mild, since of 2,590 prisoners only forty-four contracted
the disease and only three died. The garrison,
which averaged 2,876 men, was somewhat more severely
attacked; 109 men contracted the disease (37·9 per 1,000),
and four succumbed to it. The epidemic became unusually
widespread in the city; 114 inhabitants (98·8 per 10,000)
succumbed to small-pox there in the year 1871.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of 5,000 prisoners confined in Lockstedt, 47 contracted
small-pox, the first in October, and the rest in February;
only a few men in the German garrison were attacked by
the disease. From Lockstedt the disease spread to the
surrounding country, including Itzehoe, where it caused
102 deaths (110·6 per 10,000 inhabitants) in the year 1871.
From there small-pox spread in all directions; it was conveyed
to Stollmarn chiefly by working-men from Hamburg
and Altona who lived in the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the city of Lübeck, the population of which in the year
1871 was 52,158, the following number of people, according
to the report of the local Bureau of Statistics, contracted
and succumbed to small-pox:</p>

<p class='c020'>Judging from this table, the city was not very severely
attacked by the disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the province of Hanover, small-pox did not become
very widespread in the years 1871 and 1872, thanks to the
introduction of compulsory vaccination; this is evident
from one of the tables reproduced above. In the year 1871
the districts of Osterode and Harburg had the highest figures,
32·4 and 18·7 deaths respectively per 10,000 inhabitants,
and in the following year Osterode had 47·4 and Einbeck
was second with 24·6. In the city of Hanover the cases
of the disease in the garrison were few and far between;
the first cases among the prisoners were reported in August;
their maximum number was 2,299, and fifty-six of them
contracted the disease and three died. In the city seventy-one
persons succumbed to the disease in the year 1871, and
eighty-nine persons in the year 1872 (8·1 and 10·2, respectively,
per 10,000 inhabitants). In Hildesheim, cases of the
disease, which had been brought there from France, were
reported in March 1871; seven soldiers in the garrison were
taken sick. In Göttingen (Governmental District of Hildesheim)
persons who had contracted the disease in France
were taken to the lazaret in March 1871; whether or not
this was responsible for the communication of the disease
to the civil inhabitants, among whom a severe epidemic had
never before raged, cannot be ascertained. At Einbeck
(Governmental District of Hildesheim) several small-pox
convalescents belonging to the field-army arrived in February
1871. In Osnabrück a soldier belonging to the field-army
contracted the disease in December. In Papenburg (Governmental
District of Osnabrück) the dépôt where the prisoners
were confined was very severely attacked; of 993 prisoners,
sixty-three contracted the disease and two died. In Lingen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>(Governmental District of Osnabrück) there was a rather
large number of Frenchmen suffering from small-pox—fifty-three,
all told, of whom three died. In Stade thirty-two
out of 2,284 prisoners contracted the disease in January
and February, and five of them died.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Bremen the epidemic of small-pox did not become very
widespread. According to a report issued by the local
Bureau of Statistics, there were only twenty-six cases of
the disease there in the year 1870 and no deaths; in the
following years the number of deaths was as follows:<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c011'><sup>[273]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg the number
of deaths due to small-pox is unknown. In the city of
Oldenburg three French prisoners (two in October and one
in November) contracted small-pox, and one case of the
disease was reported in the garrison in March. Regarding
the appearance of small-pox among the civil inhabitants no
information is available.</p>

<p class='c007'>The governmental districts of Münster and Minden
(Province of Westphalia) were only moderately afflicted by
small-pox in the years 1870–2. According to Guttstadt,
a few cases of the disease were reported in the city of Münster
in May 1869, and these were followed by seven more in July
1870. After that no cases were reported until November 9,
1870, when a pastor, who had been ministering to the prisoners
in Lingen, contracted the disease; another pastor fared in
the same way. These were followed by eight more cases in
two buildings in Münster itself, and another two in the community
of Überwasser, which bordered on the city of Münster.
In the latter part of the year 1870 no cases were reported in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>the garrison. In the latter part of January 1871 some 3,000
prisoners were brought from Wesel, which was badly infected
with the disease, to Münster, and there four of them were
immediately taken sick. This was the beginning of a rather
extensive epidemic among the prisoners, 143 of whom contracted
the disease and thirteen died; the maximum number
of cases (107) was reported in February. In the garrison,
which numbered 3,910 men, a small number of cases was
reported from February on; of twenty-one cases reported,
one resulted fatally. In the same month a small epidemic
raged among the civil inhabitants, reaching its climax in
May. The following table indicates the number of people
who contracted the disease:</p>

<p class='c020'>The number of deaths in the year 1871 was sixty-seven
(26·9 per 10,000 inhabitants), and in the year 1872 it was
twenty-two; most of the cases occurred in the quarters
of the city known as Jüdefeld and Lamberti, on account of
the proximity of the prison along the Buddenturm. In the
surrounding communities the epidemic reached its climax
in July, and after that began to abate rapidly. The only
other region in the Governmental District of Münster in
which small-pox made its appearance was Recklinghausen,
which borders on the Rhenish-Westphalian coal-fields, whence
the infection doubtless came; in Recklinghausen there were
28·8 deaths per 10,000 inhabitants in the year 1871, and
46·4 per 10,000 in the year 1872.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Governmental District of Minden only the city and
vicinity of Minden were severely attacked; before the war
began they were free from small-pox. On September 10 the
first prisoners arrived, and among them cases of small-pox
had already been observed in the first part of that month;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>in the course of the next eight days more cases were reported,
and of a total number of 5,071 prisoners 98 contracted the
disease and 13 succumbed to it. In the garrison, which
numbered 5,071 men, one case was reported in October,
four in December, and fifty-two in the following months;
only two cases terminated fatally. The first case among
the civil inhabitants was reported on November 5; the
victim was a laundress who had done washing for the
prisoners. This constituted the beginning of an epidemic
in which 651 persons contracted the disease and 114 succumbed
to it; the population of the city was 16,862. The
epidemic spread to the surrounding localities, presumably
because the woollen blankets which the patients had used
were sold there. Throughout the entire district of Minden
391 persons (51·0 per 10,000 inhabitants) succumbed to
small-pox in the year 1871, whereas in the following year
only 34 deaths were reported, all told.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Governmental District of Arnsberg the districts of
Dortmund and Bochum, which belonged to the Rhenish-Westphalian
coal region, and were even at that time densely
populated, were severely attacked by small-pox; the districts
of Hamm and Hagen, which bordered on the latter,
were likewise very hard hit. The following table indicates
the number of persons per 10,000 inhabitants that succumbed
to small-pox in the districts mentioned:</p>

inhabitants) succumbed to small-pox in the year 1871;
almost one-half of the deaths that year were caused by
small-pox. The city of Dortmund itself was less severely
attacked in the year 1871 than the country surrounding it;
in the city alone 96 persons (21·5 per 10,000) died of the
disease, whereas in the district of Dortmund, excluding the
city, there were 661 deaths (71·4 per 10,000). The near-by
city of Hamm was very severely attacked; 114 persons
(67·3 per 10,000) succumbed there in the year 1871, whereas
the total number of deaths in the rest of the district amounted
to 113 (26·5 per 10,000). According to Guttstadt, a prisoner
contracted the disease there on November 2 and subsequently
died. The first cases among the civil inhabitants
were reported on November 22; the victims were an
occupant of a public-house situated near the lazaret, and
a Catholic priest who had visited the patients.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Rhine Province the districts of the Rhenish-Westphalian
industrial centre belonging to the Governmental
District of Düsseldorf also suffered severely from small-pox:
e.g. the districts of Crefeld, Duisburg, Düsseldorf, Essen,
Mettmann, Elberfeld, and Barmen; later on, in the year
1872, the districts of Lennep and Solingen were also severely
attacked. The districts in the Governmental District of

<p class='c007'>On August 17 and 18, seven infected Frenchmen arrived
at the city of Düsseldorf and were at once isolated in a house
outside the city limits; in November a few more infected
prisoners arrived. In the small German garrison (523 men)
no cases were observed until later (April and May). In
December 1870, 20 cases among the civil inhabitants were
reported; they constituted the beginning of an epidemic
which developed rapidly, reached its climax in July with
648 cases, and then quickly disappeared. In the following
year, 524 small-pox patients (75·0 per 10,000 inhabitants)
died in the city of Düsseldorf.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the district of Duisburg eleven cases of small-pox were
reported in December 1870, and here again the epidemic
developed rapidly, reaching its climax (1,549 cases) in May
1871. The city of Duisburg was most severely attacked;
529 persons (173·2 per 10,000 inhabitants) died there of
small-pox in the year 1871.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the stronghold of Wesel (district of Rees), where the
prisoners were confined in the stronghold itself on Buderich
Island and Spellmer Heath, persons suffering from small-pox
arrived in August and September; and still more arrived
in November with a transport of prisoners from Metz. Of
the 16,299 prisoners, 1,042 (63·9 per 1,000) contracted
small-pox, and 127 (12·2 per cent of those taken sick) died;
the largest number of cases was reported in January. In the
garrison, which numbered 7,284 men, there were 117 cases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>of the disease and seven deaths. Since the inhabitants of
the city of Wesel and of the surrounding country had
continual intercourse with the prisoners, the dissemination
of the disease was inevitable; the epidemic among the civil
inhabitants began in November and carried away nine
persons in 1870 and eighty-four persons in 1871.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Elberfeld the epidemic did not become very widespread
until December 1871. The first fatal case in the city
of Essen was reported in January 1871; the epidemic then
increased in fury until June 1871 (48 deaths), when it began
to abate. In the following year it revived a little in May,
when 26 cases were reported. All told, 272 persons (53·0

<p class='c007'>In the Governmental District of Cologne small-pox became
more or less widespread in the years 1871–2 in the city and
immediate vicinity of Cologne; in the few years preceding
the war Cologne had had numerous cases of the disease, and
in the year 1866 a small epidemic (223 cases) had occurred
there; in the year 1869 some forty cases were officially
reported. According to Guttstadt, the first transport of
prisoners, among them a small-pox patient, passed through
Cologne early in September. Of the gradually increasing
number of prisoners (the maximum number, including Deutz,
was 13,774) 175, all told, contracted the disease and twenty-four
succumbed to it. In the garrison, which numbered
9,207 men, there were only nineteen cases of the disease and
one death. Among the civil inhabitants an epidemic broke
out as early as September 12; it reached its climax in April
1871, abated somewhat during the summer, and in October
and November started up again. The following table indicates
the number of people that contracted and succumbed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>to the disease in the months mentioned (the population of
the city at that time was 129,000):</p>

<p class='c007'>According to this table, 63 persons (4·9 per 10,000 inhabitants)
died in the months September-December 1870, and
416 persons (32·2 per 10,000) died in the year 1871; in the
following year 25 more deaths (1·9 per 10,000) were reported.
In the district of Cologne (excluding the city) 212 persons
(24·3 per 10,000 inhabitants) succumbed to small-pox in
the year 1871; in all the other districts the number of deaths
caused by the disease was small.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Governmental District of Coblenz the city of
Coblenz and the adjacent districts of Neuwied and Mayen,
as well as the district of Kreuznach, which lay in the extreme
south and very near the scene of the war, were most severely
attacked in the year 1871. In the stronghold of Coblenz,
according to Guttstadt, a locksmith contracted the disease
in the latter part of August; he had become infected while
sitting beside the body of his brother, who had succumbed
to the disease in Casbach, a village near Lingen, in Hanover.
The first prisoners arrived in Coblenz on September 15, and
on September 23 one of them was found to be suffering from
small-pox and was taken to the lazaret; new transports
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>of prisoners kept bringing more cases of the disease. Of the
15,011 French prisoners that arrived there, a large number
contracted the disease; the maximum number was in January,
when 571 (38·0 per 1,000) were taken sick, and 111 died
(19·4 per cent of the patients). In the garrison, which consisted
of 8,710 men, there were 83 cases of the disease and
four deaths in the month of November. Among the civil
inhabitants of Coblenz 81 persons (24·2 per 10,000) died
of small-pox in the year 1871; in the rest of the district
of Coblenz 277 persons (67·1 per 10,000) died; in the
district of Mayen there were 234 deaths (43·9 per 10,000), in
the district of Neuwied 220 deaths (32·3), and in the district
of Kreuznach 129 deaths (21·2). In the year 1872 the
epidemic was not at all widespread in any of the districts.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Governmental District of Aix-la-Chapelle only the
district of Malmedy suffered severely in the year 1871;
being in the south-western part of the governmental district
it was, like the border districts in the Governmental District
of Trèves mentioned below, exposed to the first onrush of
the transports of prisoners. The number of deaths there in
the year 1871 was 333 (111·0 per 10,000), whereas in the
following year not a single death due to small-pox was
reported in the district. At Jülich a Frenchman suffering
from small-pox arrived in July, and in November an epidemic
broke out among the prisoners; 188 cases of small-pox were
reported, and of these only three terminated fatally. In the
garrison only one man contracted the disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>The governmental district of Trèves had a very large
number of small-pox cases in the year 1871, since a large
part of it bordered directly on the enemy’s country, so that
large numbers of sick and convalescent prisoners passed
through it. In the year 1872 only a few cases of small-pox
were reported, except in the immediate vicinity of Trèves,
where the pestilence became quite widespread. The following
table indicates the number of deaths per 10,000 inhabitants
in the districts mentioned:</p>

<p class='c007'>The province of Hesse-Nassau suffered very little from
small-pox in the years 1871–2, since a compulsory vaccination
law had long been in force there. Large epidemics did not
occur anywhere. In Cassel a case of small-pox had occurred
in the summer of 1870, and after that there were no more
cases until November 9; on that day a man was taken sick
who had been acting as a sutler among the German troops
before Paris and had there been infected. On November 18
a nurse employed in a house in which a field-soldier was
quartered contracted the disease, and this case was followed
by six more cases among the civil inhabitants;
all told, six persons succumbed to small-pox in the city of
Cassel in the year 1870, ninety-nine persons (21·4 per 10,000
inhabitants) in the year 1871, and four persons in the
year 1872.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Frankfurt-on-the-Main a few cases of small-pox were
reported in the course of the year 1870; the disease was
perhaps conveyed thither from Stuttgart. After the commencement
of the war it was borne into the city by numerous
transports of soldiers and prisoners, and a widespread
epidemic soon developed. In the garrison thirty-two cases
of the disease were reported. After the Rochus Hospital
was opened to small-pox patients, in April, the epidemic
reached its climax; the following table, found in the German
Health Report, indicates the number of patients received

<p class='c013'>The kingdom of Saxony experienced a very severe
epidemic of small-pox in consequence of the Franco-German
War. The wide dissemination of the disease is attributed by
Wunderlich to the fact that vaccination, in consequence of
the wild agitation of the anti-vaccinationists, was insufficiently
practised; prior to the year 1874 vaccination was
not compulsory in Saxony. Even before the war broke out
small-pox had appeared in Saxony in the form of epidemics,
e.g. in Chemnitz and Freiberg. The following table indicates
the number of persons, all told, that succumbed to small-pox

<p class='c020'>According to this table the number of deaths in the district
of Leipzig, the population of which was 97,100, was eight in the
year 1870, 1,417 (145·9 per 10,000 inhabitants) in the year
1871, and 60 in the year 1872. Accurate figures regarding
the ratio of deaths to total cases cannot be computed; at
all events small-pox raged very severely, owing partly to
insufficient vaccination, and partly to the wretched conditions
in which the working people lived.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Dresden, mild epidemics of small-pox had raged in
the year 1864 and again in the years 1867–8; between the
months of January and August 1870 not a single small-pox
patient was taken to the city hospital; the first case was
committed to the hospital on September 27 of that year,
and after that two more persons contracted the disease in
a barrack. The disease spread from there, at first along the
streets in the vicinity of the barrack, and then throughout
the Antonstadt, Neustadt, and finally the Altstadt. The
epidemic reached its climax among the civil inhabitants in
April 1871, in the garrison in January. The following table
indicates the number of patients committed to the city
hospital in the months mentioned:<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c011'><sup>[278]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c020'>All told, there were fifteen deaths due to the disease in
Dresden in the year 1870, 570 deaths (32·7 per 10,000
inhabitants) in the year 1871, and 151 deaths (8·4 per 10,000)
in the year 1872. Among the prisoners there were 150
cases of the disease, and of these nine were fatal; in the
garrison there were 413 cases and twenty-one deaths.</p>

<p class='c007'>The epidemic of small-pox in Chemnitz, at least the beginning
of it, was in no way connected with the war. An exhaustive
report made out by Flinzer,<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c011'><sup>[279]</sup></a> who carefully investigated
the conditions relative to vaccination in the year 1871,
furnishes us the following figures; of 64,255 inhabitants
53,891 were vaccinated, 5,712 were unvaccinated, 4,652 had
survived a previous attack of small-pox, and only 1,928
persons had been vaccinated more than once. The epidemic
of small-pox began in January 1870, and reached its climax
in December of that year. From March 1871 to September
1872, only a few cases of the disease were observed, but after
September the number of cases suddenly began to grow
larger, resulting in a second severe epidemic, which continued
to increase in severity until March 1873. The mortality
statistics found in Flinzer’s report are reproduced below;
they go only as far as April 1873, but after that the epidemic
abated considerably:</p>

<p class='c007'>A particularly good idea of the protection against small-pox
afforded by vaccination is given in the Chemnitz statistics
for the years 1870–1. Of 53,891 vaccinated persons 953
(1·8 per cent) contracted the disease in those two years and
seven succumbed to it, all of whom were more than ten years
of age; of 5,712 unvaccinated persons, almost one-half
contracted the disease (2,643 or 46·3 per cent, to be precise),
and of these 243 (9·16 of those taken sick) died. Of those
who died, 102 were less than one year old, 51 were less than
two years old, 47 were in their fourth or fifth year, and 20
were from five to ten years of age.</p>

<p class='c007'>How dangerous small-pox showed itself to be after the
Franco-German War is indicated by a report of Geissler<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c011'><sup>[280]</sup></a>
regarding the epidemic in Meerane, a manufacturing town
of some 20,000 inhabitants. There, between October 1871
and May 1872, no less than 460 persons (434 children and
26 adults) succumbed to small-pox, i.e. 230 per 10,000
inhabitants. Of the children 80·3, and of the adults 26·3,
succumbed to the disease in the course of the epidemic.</p>

<h5 class='c014'><em>(c) Small-pox in Bavaria in the Years 1871–2</em></h5>

<p class='c013'>In the year 1866 Bavaria had an epidemic of small-pox,
which, although it abated considerably in the following
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>years, did not leave the country entirely free from the disease;
it was, however, confined to a very few localities in the year
1870. In Upper Bavaria cases were reported in that year
only in Altötting and Friedberg; in Lower Bavaria absolutely
no cases were reported; in Upper Franconia a small epidemic
raged in August 1870, in the district of Forchheim; in
Central Franconia, where in the year 1868 a rather severe
epidemic had raged, the disease had almost entirely disappeared
by 1870; Lower Franconia and Swabia, finally,
had only sporadic cases of the disease. French prisoners and
homeward-bound soldiers, away on furlough, caused the
pestilence, as was reported from all sides, to break out anew;
the rapid dissemination of the disease, according to these
reports, was helped by persons coming in direct contact
with French prisoners in crowded places, by teamsters returning
from France, by German fugitives from France,
by persons handling the linen and clothes of patients, and
by the sale of woollen blankets and other things which the
French prisoners brought with them. The following table
indicates the number of people who succumbed to small-pox
in Bavaria:<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c011'><sup>[281]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c020'>In the second half of the year 1872 there were two more
deaths due to small-pox. The total number of deaths caused

a new epidemic began and carried away many people, particularly
in Stuttgart, but also in the rest of the Neckar

<p class='c020'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>It is impossible to prove that the recrudescence of the disease
in Stuttgart in the latter part of 1870 was in any way connected
with the arrival of infected persons from France.
In the garrison, which numbered some 3,000 men, only four
mild cases occurred, inasmuch as all recruits had been vaccinated
in Württemberg since the year 1833. But in the
latter part of the year 1870 there arrived a battalion of the
Landwehr, a third of whom had never done active service,
and had therefore never been revaccinated in accordance
with the military regulation; after this, numerous cases
were reported in the garrison (October 1870 to April 1871),
although none of them resulted fatally.</p>

<p class='c007'>The connexion between the epidemic in the stronghold
of Ulm and the war was very obvious. Says Volz:<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c011'><sup>[287]</sup></a>
‘After the summer of 1870 had produced only a few cases
of small-pox, and a long pause (August to the beginning of
November) had intervened, during which we saw absolutely
no traces of the disease, the arrival of French prisoners
caused the disease to spread far and wide, constituting
a part of the epidemic which raged throughout almost all
of Europe. In the latter part of September the first cases
of small-pox were observed among the prisoners. But
a month and a half elapsed before the disease made its appearance
among the civil inhabitants; one of the first cases was
traced to the beds in the barracks. In January 1871 the
disease was conveyed to Söflingen by a woman from that
place who had been employed as a nurse in the military
hospital at New Ulm. The constant intercourse between
Söflingen and Ulm soon asserted itself through the infection
of working-men who were employed in the latter place and
lived in the former. At the same time the disease frequently
appeared among the laundry-owners, washerwomen, scrubwomen,
innkeepers, sutler-women, and generally among persons
who were employed in any capacity in the field-hospitals
and forts. Then, too, patients kept arriving who had been
infected in Baden, Switzerland, Bavaria, North Germany,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>and in regions which, like ours, had been infected by prisoners
and fugitives arriving from France. In the district of
Beimerstetten the disease also made its appearance, having
been brought there in a carpet which a woman purchased
from a Bavarian soldier who had accompanied a transport
of prisoners. In addition to this woman, sixteen more persons
contracted the disease, and three of them died.’</p>

<p class='c007'>In the city of Ulm thirty-six civilians (13·7 per 10,000
inhabitants) succumbed to the disease, while in the district
of Ulm forty-six persons (21·2 per 10,000) died. The climax
of the epidemic was reached in May; after a short lull in
August and September it started up again and lasted until
the autumn of 1872. The garrison at Ulm was also attacked,
but not very severely.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the immobile troops in Württemberg, who averaged
10,122 men, 7·9 per 1,000 contracted the disease. Of the
French prisoners that were held in Württemberg, 390 contracted
the disease (the climax, 199 cases, was reached in
December). The maximum number of prisoners was 12,958,
and 30·1 per 1,000 contracted the disease and twenty-eight
died (7·2 per cent of those taken sick).</p>

<p class='c007'>In Heilbronn,<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c011'><sup>[288]</sup></a> as in Stuttgart, a small epidemic had raged
before the war broke out; from February to July 1870 some
forty persons had contracted the disease. From August to
October no more cases were reported, but in November
a new epidemic began and spread with great rapidity. The

nothing. Among the civil inhabitants a small epidemic

<p class='c007'>While small-pox made its appearance here and there in
the first half of the year 1870, it did not acquire epidemic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>dimensions until after the outbreak of the war. In many
places, to be sure, it was impossible to prove that the disease
was directly connected with the war. Reissner and Neidhart
mention numerous cases in which the disease was communicated
by field-soldiers who were sent from France to Hessian
reserve-lazarets (Pfungstadt, Lampertheim, Crumstadt, and
others), by furloughed field-soldiers (Lauterbach, Lorsch,
Eschollbrücken, and others), by fugitives from Paris at the
beginning of the war (Giessen, Gross-Eichen), by French
prisoners who had contracted the disease in camp or during
transport, by teamsters returning home from France (Worms,
Grossgerau), by military effects—such as carpets, clothing,
tent-canvas (three places in the district of Grossgerau),
and especially by people who had visited the prisons where
the French soldiers were confined (Mayence, Darmstadt, &amp;c.).</p>

<p class='c007'>Not a single district in Hesse was spared during the epidemic
of the years 1870–2. The district of Mayence suffered
worst of all; then came Giessen, Offenbach, and Darmstadt,
all districts in which moderately large cities were located.

<p class='c007'>In the city of Mayence about thirty cases of small-pox were
reported in the year 1870 before the war broke out. ‘Shortly
after the beginning of the war,’ say Reissner and Neidhart,
‘numerous prisoners were interned in Mayence, and among
them cases of small-pox had not infrequently been observed
beforehand. Notwithstanding the admonitions of the
military physician, a barrack inside the city was set aside
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>as a lazaret for them. At first in the near-by streets, but
later on throughout the entire city, an epidemic now began
to rage such as Mayence had never before experienced in
the memory of man. It lasted throughout the entire year
of 1871 and did not come to an end until the middle of the
following year.’ The epidemic reached its climax in Mayence
in January 1871, abated a little until March, started up
again in April, and then slowly decreased in fury until it
finally disappeared altogether. In the garrison at Mayence
190 men contracted the disease in the years 1870–2 and nine
succumbed to it; of the prisoners of war 934 contracted the
disease and seventeen per cent of them died. The pestilence
was disseminated in all directions from Mayence, partly by
people from the surrounding country who visited the city,
and partly by other means. Thus, for example, the disease
broke out with unusual severity in Bretzenheim, a village
situated a mile or so away from the barracks where the
prisoners were confined; the inhabitants of the village in
many instances used the contents of the ditches in which
the defecations of the prisoners were thrown to fertilize their
fields, and they also bought straw and other waste products
in the city.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the city of Giessen no cases of small-pox occurred in
the year 1870 prior to the outbreak of the war. The first
cases observed there were in September, but the epidemic,
which reached its climax in December, did not become very
widespread. In Darmstadt 50 cases of small-pox were
reported in the year 1870 prior to the outbreak of the war,
and after the war began some 50–60 cases were observed
before the end of the year. The epidemic, which became
only moderately widespread, lasted throughout the entire
year of 1871 and did not disappear until the middle of the
year 1872.</p>

<p class='c013'>In connexion with the Franco-German War an epidemic
of small-pox raged throughout Germany, the extent and
virulence of which exceeded that of any other epidemic that
occurred in the entire course of the nineteenth century.
Unfortunately, in the case of a number of small States, we
have no statistics relating to the number of deaths caused
by the disease. The figures which I was able to obtain
I have compiled in the following table. In the case of Alsace
and Lorraine, as well as of Oldenburg, the two Mecklenburgs,
and the other small North German States, absolutely no
figures are available; judging by their population and by
the prevalence of small-pox in the States surrounding them,
we may safely estimate the number of deaths caused by small-pox
in them in the years 1871–2 at some 4,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>The above compilation leaves no doubt that the disease
was borne into Germany from France. The contagion was
conveyed into Germany by prisoners and field-soldiers, some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>of whom were infected beforehand and were sick when they
got there, others of whom were still apparently healthy, and
still others of whom had reached the convalescent stage of
the disease, and less frequently by civil persons (teamsters
and fugitives); but the prisoners were by far the most
active influence in spreading the disease. The dissemination
usually took place in the following manner; in the dépôts
where the prisoners were confined, small-pox epidemics of
varying severity broke out; from all sides the people
streamed in to see the prisoners, and when they went away
they conveyed the infection wherever they went, at first,
of course, around in the immediate vicinity. This is most
evident in the eastern provinces, where these dépôts soon
came to be dangerous seats of small-pox infection; the near-by
districts were very severely attacked as early as the year
1871, whereas the more remote districts did not begin to
suffer severely until the year 1872.</p>

<p class='c007'>The development of a small trade between the prisoners
and civil inhabitants in articles belonging to dead soldiers,
or in personal effects, also helped to spread the disease; moreover,
certain unscrupulous sick-attendants, when they were
instructed to destroy such articles, frequently disobeyed the
order and secretly sold them, thereby giving an additional
impetus to the dissemination of the disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fact that a large part of the population was not
vaccinated, and that the necessity of revaccination was not
properly recognized (only soldiers were revaccinated), also
helped to increase the severity of the pestilence. In all the
South German States compulsory vaccination had existed
for decades, but its strict enforcement was everywhere
hindered by the activity of the anti-vaccinationists; Prussia
and Saxony did not introduce compulsory vaccination until
the year 1874. Revaccination among the civil inhabitants
was rarely practised in either North or South Germany.
These differences in the vaccination laws account for the fact
that small-pox raged more severely in North Germany than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>in South Germany; this is also distinctly shown by the tables
reproduced in the course of this chapter. The fact that the
civil inhabitants in general were more thoroughly vaccinated
also explains why the percentage of children that succumbed
to small-pox was so much smaller in South Germany than in
North Germany.</p>

<p class='c007'>The number of deaths caused by small-pox in the epidemic
of the years 1870–2 was greatly increased by the extremely
virulent character of the disease. Of course one cannot
estimate the number of deaths caused by small-pox among
the civil inhabitants from the number of reported cases of
the disease, since the reports sent in were always very incomplete.
We know that the mortality of small-pox depends
very much upon vaccination; vaccinated persons succumb
far less frequently to the disease than unvaccinated persons.
This fact explains why among the German field-soldiers, who
were constantly subjected to hardships and privations of all
kinds, only 5·75 per cent of the patients died, whereas of the
French prisoners some 13·85 per cent died. The mortality
among the civil inhabitants of Germany was also very high;
this was chiefly due to the fact that severe forms of the
disease, particularly hemorrhagic small-pox, were of frequent
occurrence. As authority for this we can only refer to these
reports of the hospitals; but since small children, amongst
whom the mortality of small-pox is very high, are less
represented in them, and, on the other hand, since mild
cases among adults can more readily be withdrawn from
hospital treatment, one cannot accept without qualification
the experience of the hospitals. According to Wunderlich,
of 681 patients treated in the Leipzig hospital between the
year 1852 and July 1870, only 29 (4·2 per cent) died, whereas
in the years 1870–1, of 1,727 patients treated, 253 (14·7 per
cent) died. In Breslau, whereas in former epidemics an
average of seven per cent of the patients died, in the epidemic
of the years 1871–2 no less than 13·4 per cent died. Guttstadt
also states that the mortality in the Berlin hospitals was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>fifteen per cent, whereas the number of deaths caused by
the disease in former years was much smaller. We have
seen above that 21·7 per cent of the patients taken to the
Hôtel-Dieu in Lyons died. It is unnecessary to adduce
further statistics; all contemporary observers agreed that
the epidemic involved an extremely severe and virulent form
of the disease, and that this same virulence characterized the
disease wherever it made its appearance.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>5. <em>The Epidemics of Small-pox that raged in the European, and in a few of the non-European States in connexion with the Franco-German War of 1870–1</em></h4>

<h5 class='c014'><em>(a) Switzerland</em></h5>

<p class='c013'>Switzerland was exposed to great danger in consequence of
the passage of General Bourbaki’s army, which consisted
partly of very young soldiers who had suffered great hardships,
including cold and hunger, and which contained large numbers
of men who were suffering from small-pox. The little
country was called upon to take in some 85,000 men; when
the latter were examined on the frontier a large number of
them were found to be infected with small-pox and were
held at Verrière in France. But this did not prevent the
disease from being conveyed across the border. Of the
French prisoners confined there, 137, all told, succumbed to
small-pox.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unfortunately no mortality statistics giving the cause of
death were compiled in Switzerland until the year 1876, so
that we have no figures indicating the prevalence of small-pox.
The western cantons were most exposed to the infection.
In Berne, which at that time had a population of 506,511,
no less than 2,637 persons, excluding the French prisoners
interned there, contracted the disease between October 1870
and September 1872; in the year 1871 there were 9·6 deaths
per 10,000 inhabitants.<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c011'><sup>[293]</sup></a> In the city of Basel, which was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>attacked as early as November 1870, the epidemic reached
its climax in February; the number of deaths there was as

<p class='c007'>The Canton of Basel (Land) was attacked somewhat less
severely; in the year 1871 only 59 persons (10·9 per 10,000
inhabitants) succumbed there to small-pox. In the Canton of
Solothurn, which was infected from Olten, a railway junction,
13·9 persons per 10,000 inhabitants died in the year 1871.
In the Canton of Waadt small-pox broke out, according to
Vogt, in the district of Vivis in November 1870, and 200
persons contracted the disease in the course of that month.
In the two small-pox hospitals at Lausanne, 351 patients
were treated between November 20, 1870, and the end of
1871, and 62 of them died.</p>

<p class='c007'>The small-pox epidemic spread very rapidly from the West
throughout all the rest of Switzerland, partly in consequence
of the distribution of the French prisoners among the other
cantons, and partly in consequence of inland intercourse.
Of the French prisoners interned in the Canton of Zurich 180,
according to A. Brunner,<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c011'><sup>[295]</sup></a> contracted the disease and 31 died
of it. The patients were sheltered in the small-pox camp
at Winterthur, whence the infection spread to many places.
In February 1871 there was a rapid increase in the number
of cases; the epidemic reached its climax in March and April,
and then steadily abated until June. The statistics for the
Canton of Zurich, which had a population of 285,915, were
as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Canton of Thurgau, according to Vogt, there were
9·2 deaths per 10,000 inhabitants in the year 1871, in the
Canton of Schaffhausen 4·0, and in the Canton of St. Gall 3·3.
During the small-pox epidemic that raged in the Canton of
Schwyz in the year 1871 the communities of Gersau and
Küssnacht were severely attacked; throughout the entire
canton 56 persons (11·7 per 10,000 inhabitants) succumbed
to the disease. The Cantons of Glarus, Unterwalden, Zug,
and Graubünden were also rather severely attacked. In the
Canton of Tessin, whither the disease, which first appeared
in Locarno, had been conveyed by travellers from Paris, and
where 62 cases of it and 6 deaths had been reported up to
June, a new epidemic broke out in Personico, resulting in
15 deaths; in the year 1871 there were 11 deaths reported
throughout the entire canton. In the Canton of Willis
small-pox broke out only sporadically.</p>

<h5 class='c014'><em>(b) Belgium</em></h5>

<p class='c013'>In numerous places throughout Belgium small-pox had
appeared in the first part of the year 1870 in the form of
widespread epidemics, a fact which we can readily explain
when we consider the country’s proximity to France, which
was everywhere infected with the disease. Thus, according
to Larondelle, a severe epidemic of small-pox broke out in
February 1870, in the city of Verviers, which at that time
had some 33,000 inhabitants, and lasted until January 1871;
in the year 1870 no less than 428 deaths were reported there,
and 185 of them occurred in the month of December alone.
When the war began French fugitives kept bringing the
disease into the country, especially after the battle of Sedan,
when more than 10,000 French soldiers were interned on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>Belgian soil, some in Beverloo and others in the citadel of
Antwerp. From these places the epidemic spread throughout
all Belgium. In Brussels, for example, no cases of small-pox
were reported in July 1870, in August there were two cases,
in September two, in October twenty-two, in November
sixty-nine, and in December 101. In all Belgium the
number of deaths caused by small-pox was:<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c011'><sup>[296]</sup></a></p>

<h5 class='c014'><em>(c) Netherlands</em></h5>

<p class='c013'>In the Netherlands an epidemic of small-pox had raged in
the year 1866; in the following year it had rapidly abated, and
in the year 1869 had caused only fifty deaths in the three

mortality was generally low in Austria. The small epidemic
in Bukowina in the year 1871 had no causal connexion with
the Franco-German War; it was an epidemic such as had
often broken out in former years in the countries of eastern
Austria, and such as still break out occasionally nowadays.
On the other hand, a considerable increase in the number
of deaths caused by small-pox is observed in the year 1871
in Lower Austria and Salzburg, and to a certain extent in
East Austria, Moravia, Silesia, and Bohemia; in Lower
Austria, Salzburg, and Silesia the epidemic reached its
climax in the year 1872, whereas in Upper Austria, Bohemia,
and Moravia this climax did not come until the year 1873.
The same is true of Vorarlberg, while the crown-lands of
Styria, Carinthia, Carniola, and Tyrol were most severely
attacked by the disease in 1874. In Triest and Istria the
climax of the epidemic was reached in 1872, in Görz
and Gradiska in 1873. In Galicia, which had always had
a high small-pox mortality, the epidemic did not begin until
the year 1872; it reached its climax in the following year.
In Bukowina the climax did not come until the year 1874.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘To follow the progress of the disease according to political
districts,’ says Daimer, ‘is instructive for the reason that,
as was clearly shown at that time, it always spread slowly—a
fact which was also repeatedly observed in the case of
other epidemics; thus, there was always time enough to
adopt appropriate measures aiming to check its progress.’
There is a very marked difference between the epidemic
of small-pox in East Austria and the one in Germany; the
latter attacked all Germany within a short time, since the
war had developed there a very extensive intercourse. And
even in Germany it was observed that the disease was a long
time in reaching those regions that were less affected by this
intercourse.</p>

<p class='c007'>But in these cities the epidemic did not come to an end;
epidemic outbreaks of small-pox continued to occur in Vienna
until 1885, in Prague until 1893, and in a number of years
(for example, 1877, 1880, 1883, 1884, and 1888) the disease
underwent some very important exacerbations.</p>

<h5 class='c014'><em>(e) Italy</em></h5>

<p class='c013'>Small-pox is supposed to have been conveyed into Italy by
the volunteers who had fought under Garibaldi; they became
infected with the disease in the Department of Côte d’Or,
where it had raged extensively, and then brought it back
with them when they returned home. In Milan 200–300
cases per annum were usually reported prior to the year 1870.
In the summer of that year the number of cases greatly
increased, terminating in the following year in a severe
epidemic which reached its climax in September and October.
According to Felice del Agua,<a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c011'><sup>[299]</sup></a> there were 1,287 cases and
152 deaths in the year 1870, and 4,467 cases and 866 deaths in
the year 1871. In Rome small-pox made its appearance in
October 1871, causing 335 deaths between October 10 and
December 31, 1871, and 727 deaths in the entire year of
1872. In the case of a large number of individual places we
have reports regarding epidemics of small-pox, but I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>unable to find a comprehensive account of the epidemic that
raged at that time in Italy.</p>

<h5 class='c014'><em>(f) Great Britain and Ireland</em></h5>

<p class='c013'>Owing to the constant intercourse between England and
France it was inevitable that small-pox should very soon
be conveyed into England; the persons who conveyed it
were probably French refugees. As on the continent, so
also in England, small-pox was always prevalent; in the
years 1869 and 1870, however, it was not very widespread,
and it did not begin to gain much headway until the autumn
of 1870. The number of deaths caused by small-pox in
England was:</p>

The compiler of the reports regarding the movement of the
population in England in the year 1871 says:<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c011'><sup>[300]</sup></a> ‘Nearly all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>the smaller outbreaks may be more or less directly traced
to one of these centres; Brighton, for instance, doubtless
suffered from its intimate communication with London.
There is distinct evidence in many cases of the introduction of
the disease into sea-side towns by sailors, and considering
its fatal prevalence in Holland, Belgium, and many parts of
France, it is not a matter for great surprise that Southampton,
Great Grimsby, and one or two other ports suffered from
the epidemic. It is indeed very probable that the epidemic
in London was due to the large arrivals of French refugees
during the latter part of the previous autumn. That the
epidemic may to a great extent be traced to our foreign
communications is beyond doubt, and it is to be regretted
that the steady decline of deaths from small-pox in the six
years 1864–9 had induced a certain apathy in the matter of
vaccination, and thus left a large portion of the population
unprotected from the disease. In times of severe epidemics
large numbers of the vaccinated in some way or other also
suffer for the neglect which has left so many unvaccinated.’</p>

<h4 class='c014'>6. <em>The Age of the Small-pox Patients. The Connexion between the Epidemic and the War. The German Imperial Vaccination Law</em></h4>

<p class='c013'>Thus far very little attention has been called to the fact
that the age of the persons who succumbed to small-pox
varied greatly in the different countries. This depends upon
how well vaccinated the population of the country or countries
was. Formerly, when nobody was ever vaccinated, the
first year of life and the following years were by far the most
seriously threatened; after the first few years the mortality
of small-pox gradually decreased as the age of the patients
increased. This also applies to-day to those countries in
which vaccination is neglected. On the other hand, in those
countries in which children are vaccinated in the first year
of their lives, the infant mortality is low, although the same
children lose their immunity to the disease when they grow
older. To illuminate these facts let us adduce a few figures.
In estimating the number of deaths, however, we cannot use
the number of the living as a relative basis to work on, since
the prevalence of small-pox varied greatly in the different
countries; consequently we must take the total number
of deaths and estimate the mortality on the basis of age
from that alone. But in doing this we can compare with
one another only entire countries in which the various ages
are all about equally represented; if we were to take smaller
units, for example, city and country, or agrarian and industrial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>districts, and use them for a basis of comparison, more
detailed computations would be necessary. Of the four
states included in the table below, Bavaria and Hesse introduced
compulsory vaccination (the law required everybody
to be vaccinated at least once) in the year 1807; Saxony and
the Netherlands, on the other hand, did not have compulsory
vaccination. Of every 100 persons who died of small-pox
the following table indicates the relative proportion on the
basis of age:</p>

<p class='c007'>This table clearly shows that vaccination protects a person
against contracting small-pox for a number of years, or at
least against succumbing to it, but that this immunity lasts
only for a certain length of time and should be prolonged by
revaccination—a fact which the Prussian military authorities
recognized and took into practical consideration for many
decades prior to the year 1870.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many have contended that the epidemic of small-pox
which ravaged a large part of Europe, from the year 1870
on, was not a consequence of the Franco-German War, but
an independent outcome of unknown conditions that were
particularly favourable to the dissemination of the disease.
The main argument used to uphold this contention is that
epidemics of small-pox had occurred in all the states in the
years before the war, without having gained such irresistible
headway, and that the disease had broken out in the form
of epidemics in many parts of Germany and the neighbouring
countries even in the first half of the year 1870. But to
refute this argument it can be clearly shown through Guttstadt’s
instructive compilation of data that the German
epidemic was in countless instances, in the case of Prussia
as well as in that of other states in the German Confederation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>brought about by the transplantation of the disease from
France. Whenever small-pox broke out anywhere in times
of peace, it was possible to keep the disease localized, through
isolation of patients and the vaccination of the inhabitants
of all regions in which fugitives from pestilence took refuge.
In the year 1870, on the other hand, the contagion of small-pox
was spread throughout all Germany in a few months;
the increased intercourse caused by the war, together with
the habit the Germans had of visiting the prisons where the
French soldiers were confined, also helped to spread the
disease in all directions.</p>

<p class='c007'>For Germany this disastrous epidemic, which throughout
the German Empire, including the Imperial Provinces,
carried away upwards of 170,000 persons, had just one good
result—it led to the passing of a law in the year 1874 which
rendered vaccination compulsory. ‘Besides taking thousands
of human lives the epidemic also caused considerable economic
loss; the care of the sick and the measures adopted to prevent
the disease from spreading necessitated large expenditures
of money, while large numbers of working-men contracted
the disease and were thus incapacitated for a long time;
furthermore, the disease left unnumerable sickly people, who
had to be further supported, and at the same time the fear
of infection interfered with commercial intercourse. Those
who managed to escape infection, or to recover from an attack
of the disease, naturally wished to run no more risks in the
future, or to expose the welfare of their families to danger
or destruction.’<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c011'><sup>[303]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In consequence of all this grave suffering, the representatives
of the people petitioned the Imperial Government to
provide as soon as possible for a uniform legislative regulation,
making universal vaccination compulsory. The desire
expressed in this petition was soon fulfilled by the submission
of a bill on February 5, 1874; the bill was passed by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>Reichstag on March 14, and received the signature of the
Kaiser on April 8, 1874. This law required all persons to
be vaccinated in the first year of their lives, and to be revaccinated
in their twelfth year; it applied generally to
all Germany.</p>

<p class='c007'>The beneficial result of the passing of this law was clearly
demonstrated in the course of the following decades. Notwithstanding
the fact that Germany is almost entirely
surrounded by states in which epidemics of small-pox, in
consequence of insufficient vaccination, are of frequent
occurrence, since the passing of the Imperial Vaccination
Law the disease has not once made its appearance on German
soil in the form of a widespread epidemic. Despite the fact
that small-pox is frequently conveyed into the country,
especially by foreign working-men, the efforts to keep it
confined within narrow limits have always been successful.
The measures which are so effective in the case of other
diseases—isolation of the patients and of suspected persons
living in the vicinity, disinfection of the room and effects
which have been used by patients—in an insufficiently
vaccinated community do not have the desired rapid success,
since the contagion of small-pox clings with extraordinary
tenacity to clothes and articles of general use. This fact
has been abundantly proved in the epidemics of small-pox
that have occurred in Europe in the course of the last few
decades.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Among the great advances made in the last few decades
of the nineteenth century must be included the successful
battle of modern hygiene against infectious diseases. This
struggle was introduced by the development of practical
hygiene in England and by the perfection of scientific
hygiene through the work of Pettenkofer. But a firm basis
on which to combat pestilence was not secured until the
brilliant discoveries of Koch and his successors pointed out
to us the cause of these pestilences, and methods were found
to demonstrate in a short time the presence of disease-germs,
even among persons who become ill but slightly, or not at
all, and who for that reason are very dangerous to those
about them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since even in time of peace the close quarters in which
soldiers live in barracks greatly favour the outbreak of
epidemics, the military authorities constantly watched and
profited by these advances in the field of disease-prevention;
and with the success of efforts to decrease the prevalence
of infectious diseases among the soldiers in time of peace,
so also in war-times it became possible to check more
thoroughly than ever before the dissemination of these
diseases. Hence the number of men carried away by
epidemics is much smaller in modern wars than used to be
the case.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>1. The Russo-Turkish War of 1877–8</span><a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c011'><sup>[304]</sup></a></h3>

<p class='c013'>The Russo-Turkish War of 1877–8, like all former wars with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>Turkey, was characterized by severe pestilences, which at
both seats of the war, the European as well as the Asiatic,
were responsible for large numbers of deaths. Typhus fever,
which frequently made its appearance in Russia and in the
Balkan Peninsula, was once more the disease which made the
greatest havoc. In the years preceding the war it had raged
in the form of epidemics in several Russian Governments, and
it is probable that the Russian army was already infected
with it. Erisman states that cases of typhus fever were
observed among the soldiers in the thirty-fifth infantry
division when it was being assembled in the Government
of Kiev; the disease also revealed its presence among the
troops when they were mustered at Kishinev (Bessarabia)
before the war broke out. In April and May 1877, when the
army was advancing toward the Danube under a steady
downpour of rain, the number of sufferers from typhus fever,
intermittent fever, and dysentery increased considerably.
During the siege of Plevna, which lasted 143 days and
terminated in the capitulation of the city on December 10,
1877, the prevalence of disease increased still more. The
march across the Balkan Peninsula in the winter of 1877–8
made great demands upon the badly nourished Russian
troops. The better conditions anticipated in the Balkan
lowlands did not show themselves; on the contrary, here
began, from the standpoint of sanitation, the most unfortunate
part of the campaign, since the retreating Turks
had devastated the entire country. The number of
typhus-fever patients in the Russian army, which numbered
some 411,000 men, increased to 18,049 in the month of
February 1878, and of these 7,522 had spotted fever and
1,540 died. The pestilence continued to rage with unbroken
severity until May; in June it began to abate.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>The total number of fever-patients and deaths in the Russian
army during its march to the Danube is indicated by the
following table:</p>

<p class='c020'>The number of men in the army increased from 217,446 in
April 1877, to 418,000 in March 1878.</p>

<p class='c007'>The military lazarets played an important and disastrous
rôle in the dissemination of typhus fever, just as they had
done in the Napoleonic Wars. ‘The lazaret-system adopted by
the Roumanians’, says Niedner,<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c011'><sup>[305]</sup></a> ‘proved utterly inadequate
for the Russians. Scarcely a third of the regular division-hospitals
and military hospitals were made mobile, and
their number, as well as their equipment, was insufficient.
The lazarets were supervised by the Hospital Department,
and consequently lacked all medical management and were
always missing wherever they were needed. The few
available lazarets were overcrowded, and being full of dirt
and refuse they merely constituted an added danger for the
patients and for the inhabitants. Not until after long delay
were additional barracks constructed, and these were so
badly arranged that they offered very little relief from the
condition of overcrowding in the hospitals. Above all, there
was a lack of means for disinfection and of clean linen, and
this rendered it inevitable that large quantities of infectious
material should accumulate in the lazarets, and that convalescents
discharged from these hospitals should be more
likely to infect other people with whom they came in contact
along the military roads.’ The transporting of these convalescents
back to Russia began in the first part of the
campaign; they not only spread the disease all along the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>military roads, but large numbers of them conveyed it back
to Russia itself, where it appeared in countless localities and
soon developed into a widespread epidemic of typhus fever.
At the end of the campaign, to be sure, conditions improved;
in the spring of the year 1878 a commission appointed for
the purpose finally succeeded in establishing certain rules
governing sanitation in the lazarets, and in bringing it about
that typhus fever patients were everywhere isolated. When
the war was over the troops were transported back home
across the Black Sea, along the coast of which, in the ports
of Réni, Nikolayev, Sebastopol, and Odessa, health-committees
had been appointed to see to it that the sick soldiers were
congregated by themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>Typhoid and typhus fever likewise became very widespread
in the Caucasian army. According to Kosloff, typhus fever
was not endemic in Armenia, as was probably the case with
typhoid fever; the Russian physicians think that it was
conveyed thither by the Russians themselves and not by
the Turks. The conditions for quartering the Russian troops
were as unfavourable as one could possibly imagine; they
were housed in dirty Armenian villages, where nobody
attended to the removal of refuse, and were badly provisioned
and inadequately supplied with clothing; this, coupled
with continuous marching and fighting, greatly reduced their
power of resistance. In October 1877 the main army was
infected with typhus fever, and the overcrowded hospitals
merely helped to spread the disease. Conditions were worst of
all in the detachment in Erivan. After the troops had gone
into winter quarters there, typhus fever broke out with
terrible severity and presently the entire government of
Erivan was suffering from the pestilence; particularly hard
hit were the cities of Erivan, Chorassan, &amp;c., where the troops
were very numerous and were exposed to the ravages of
the pestilence. The following table indicates the number
of men in the Caucasian army that contracted and succumbed
to the four diseases mentioned:</p>

<p class='c007'>The inhabitants of those regions in Asia in which fighting
took place were not attacked by typhus fever. The Turkish
troops, on the other hand, suffered severely from the
disease, though not so severely as the Russian troops; the
reason for this was that the former were better nourished
and their camps were kept clean. The Turkish prisoners
fared no better than the Russian prisoners; of 57,000
prisoners taken, 13,983 succumbed to various fevers, most
of them to typhus fever.</p>

<p class='c007'>Typhoid fever had always been prevalent in South Africa;
the first cases in the English army were observed during
the hurried march to Bloemfontein along the Modder River,
on which the soldiers were dependent for drinking-water,
despite the fact that typhoid fever was known to be raging
in places further upstream. The Berkefeld and Pasteur
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>filters yielded too little water, for the reason that they
soon became clogged; the soldiers used boiled water with
reluctance, for the reason that it took so long for it to cool.
Another source of infection besides the water was the fine
dust that was stirred up by daily wind-storms; this dust,
being full of disease-germs, contributed greatly to the dissemination
of typhoid fever. Furthermore, the crowding
together of soldiers in tents caused many of them to contract
the disease by direct communication.<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c011'><sup>[307]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Jameson, the chief of the army’s medical staff, lamented
the fact that sanitary officers (hygienists), originally appointed
to accompany each division of troops, were dismissed. The
regular doctors, who were then called upon to perform their
functions, were fully occupied with taking care of the wounded,
and were probably not well informed as to hygienic investigations
and measures. The results obtained from preventive
inoculation, which was practised on some of the soldiers,
were in general satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c007'>In other places the conditions were similar to those along
the Modder River; in Paardeberg the available drinking-water
was equally bad, and in Bloemfontein there was an
explosion-like outbreak of fever. From the beginning of
the campaign to the middle of the year 1900 there were
13,057 cases of disease in the army, and of those 3,174
terminated fatally; the total number of cases during the
entire war was no less than 42,741.</p>

<p class='c007'>The English troops that were shut up in Ladysmith from
November 1, 1899, to February 27, 1900, were very severely
attacked by typhoid fever. In the first part of November
the English garrison had consisted of 13,496 men, and by
March it had dwindled down to 10,164 men. The number of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>sick soldiers committed to the lazaret amounted to no less
than 10,668, and of these 1,766 had typhoid fever and 1,857
had dysentery; 383 of the former and 117 of the latter died.
When the Boers withdrew there were 1,996 patients in the
hospital, 708 of them suffering from typhoid fever, 341 from
dysentery, and 189 from wounds.<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c011'><sup>[308]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In the Concentration Camps which the English established
in the summer of the year 1900 for the accommodation of the
women and children in the South African Republics, the
pestilences soon gained the upper hand. Lord Roberts
had made arrangements to concentrate the families of the
Boers in camps; since the farms of the Boers were systematically
burned, these camps were supposed to protect their
wives and children against starvation, and at the same time
the wives and children served as hostages for their husbands
and fathers. When the location of these camps was decided
upon, not sanitary, but military considerations were taken
into account; it was necessary that they should be controlled
from a near-by fortress. They soon became overcrowded,
the supply of water was inadequate, and there was much
uncleanliness. The inhabitants of the camps were mostly
women, children, and old men; thus, for example, in October
1901, of the people living in the camps in the Orange Free
State, 55 per cent were children under fifteen years of age,
31.9 per cent were women, and 13.1 per cent were men,
mostly old men. According to the reports submitted to
Parliament the condition of health in the Concentration
Camps in Natal and in the Cape Colony was not unfavourable,
but in those in Transvaal and Orange it was very bad. The
following statistics, covering the time between June and
September 1901, relate to the Concentration Camps in the
Transvaal:<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c011'><sup>[309]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>All told, no less than  19,600 persons (14,894 children and
4,706 adults) died in the Concentration Camps up to March
1902; that is, about one-fifth of the total number of inhabitants
died in a period of about fifteen months. As indicated
by the above tables, the children suffered more severely than
the adults. The principal causes of the high mortality among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>the children were measles and pneumonia; since the grownup
Boers had never experienced an attack of measles in their
childhood, they too, even the very old men, contracted the
disease and many of them succumbed to it. The prevalence
of pneumonia can be explained on the ground that the
temperature fluctuated greatly in the course of the winter,
and the nights, in particular, were extremely cold. Whooping-cough,
varicella, mumps, and diphtheria were prevalent in
all the camps, and typhoid fever, which, as remarked above,
is endemic in many parts of South Africa, was very common;
so also were diarrhoea and dysentery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chief cause of the high mortality in the prison-camps
was the fact that such large numbers of men, men whose
vitality had been reduced by privations and hardships,
were congregated in places which had not been properly
prepared to receive them. The unfortunate prisoners often
reached the place of detention in a pitiable condition—exhausted
and half naked. Furthermore, they were men
who had no appreciation of the order that must be observed,
when large numbers of people are congregated in one place,
in attending to the daily requirements of nature, nor were
they willing to be taught. The result was that the ground
became filthy; the open spaces in front of the tents were
often used in place of the latrines; the contents of slop-jars
were simply thrown out in front of the doors, instead of
being emptied into receptacles that were deposited here and
there for that purpose. The mothers had no idea of nursing,
and were unwilling to take medical advice; in order to
avoid having to send their children to the hospital, they
kept secret the fact that they were sick, thus giving measles,
diphtheria, &amp;c., the best possible chance to spread. We read
in an English report:<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c011'><sup>[310]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c024'>A large share of the high death-rate in them is ascribable to the
condition in which the women and children arrive. Often they have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>been half-starved and are broken down in health. It cannot be
wondered at that under these circumstances measles and other
diseases are inordinately fatal. The dirty personal habits of the
Boers, their use of improper and often disgusting remedies, and their
ignorant errors of dietetics in regard to young children, have rendered
it extremely difficult to secure favourable results in the treatment
of cases of sickness among the Boer children. There appears to be
no doubt, as indicated in our previous special article, that the
measles which has been prevalent has been of a specially malignant
type. Its malignancy has doubtless been intensified by the dirty
condition of the Boer children, and by the overcrowding that has
been permitted in the camps, as well as by the previous bad health
of these children. The present reports afford abundant evidence
confirmatory of the conclusion at which we had previously arrived,
that dysentery, diarrhoea, and enteric fever in a large proportion of
the camps have been prevalent as well as measles.</p>

<p class='c006'>And in another report we read:<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c011'><sup>[311]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c024'>Measles of a particularly malignant type has prevailed. Its
fatality has doubtless been increased by the exhausted and semi-starved
condition in which many of the Boers and their children
have arrived at the camps. It has been impossible to isolate such
cases in the camps; and the crude and ignorant and even mischievous
methods of domestic treatment adopted by the Boer women have
doubtless increased the evil, as have also the personal uncleanliness
of the Boers and their fear of fresh air as well as of clean water.
But, as previously pointed out, enteric fever and diarrhoea and
dysentery have claimed a large toll of victims, and for the excessive
amount of these the deficient sanitary control of the camps must be
held in a large measure responsible.</p>

<p class='c006'>With the arrival of the better season, when the Concentration
Camps, under the pressure of public opinion, were
thoroughly cleansed, the condition of health improved.
Hönigsberger,<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c011'><sup>[312]</sup></a> who inspected the camp at Merebank (in
Natal) in May 1912, derived a very favourable impression;
notwithstanding the fact that the camp lay on low ground
near the sea-coast, where the soil was necessarily damp,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>there was no visible surface water because of an effective
system of drainage. The drinking-water facilities were
good. Of some 8,000 refugees sheltered there only 110 died
between the months of February and May 1902.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>3. <span class='sc'>The War in South-west Africa (1904–7)</span><a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c011'><sup>[313]</sup></a></h3>

<p class='c013'>In the very first year of the war, typhoid fever broke out
with great severity. The disease first made its appearance
in the war against the Herero nation in the first part of
April 1904; it attacked the eastern division of the army,
which was commanded by Major von Glasenapp and numbered
twenty-five officers and 509 men, in Onjatu (midway between
Windhuk and Waterberg), after the soldiers had been
exposed to rainy weather, cold nights, and extreme hardship.
On April 6 there were six cases of the disease reported, and
by April 16 the number of cases had increased to sixty-six;
the division was then transferred to Otjihaenena, where the
patients were housed in permanent lazarets and the healthy
men were quarantined. Throughout the remaining part of
the war, typhoid fever played an important rôle; the total
number of deaths in the years 1904–7 was 1,491; of these
689 succumbed to diseases, 439 of them to typhoid fever.
The soldiers who fought in the battles against the Hereros
were most severely attacked; of a total of 470 deaths 283
were caused by typhoid fever and only twenty-two by other
diseases. In the three years’ struggle against the Hottentots
some 1,200 soldiers died; 375 of them died of diseases; of
the 375 typhoid fever was responsible for 156.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c012'>4. <span class='sc'>The Russo-Japanese War of 1904–5</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>The apprehension that the Russo-Japanese War would be
accompanied by severe outbreaks of infectious diseases
turned out to be groundless. The chief danger that threatened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>both armies was typhoid fever, which is endemic in Manchuria,
and which, on account of the filthy condition of the Chinese
villages, was given an excellent opportunity to spread. In
the first place, the soldiers were prevented from being
infected by the fact that they were allowed to drink nothing
but boiled water, and were always supplied with hot water
for tea; in the second place, when they were called upon to
remain in one place for a considerable length of time, they
were quartered, not in the Chinese villages, but in earth-huts;
or, if they were compelled to live in the Chinese
villages, these were always thoroughly disinfected beforehand.
Whenever it was possible, the Japanese military
physicians, before the troops arrived in a village, investigated
the place with reference to hygienic conditions and subjected
the inhabitants to an examination. Notwithstanding all
this, large numbers of soldiers on both sides, in the course
of the war, which lasted twenty-one months, contracted
typhoid fever, diarrhoea, and dysentery. In both summers,
which are very hot in Manchuria, typhoid fever made its
appearance, to a greater extent in the second than in the
first, since the troops before and after the battle of Mukden
remained encamped for a long time in one and the same
place.<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c011'><sup>[314]</sup></a> According to the statements of the Russian General
Medical Staff,<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c011'><sup>[315]</sup></a> the total number of deaths in the Russian
army (excluding the troops at Port Arthur and the fleet)
caused by diseases was 7,960, and to these must be added the
deaths among the discharged troops; the total number of
men in the Russian army was 709,587. Even if these
figures are incomplete, nevertheless they distinctly show that
epidemic diseases, considering the long duration of the war,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>were not very prevalent. The reports of foreigners who
accompanied the Russian army agree in pronouncing the
general condition of health excellent.<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c011'><sup>[316]</sup></a> Spotted fever and
anthrax were also observed, but among both the Russians and
the Japanese they appeared only sporadically. According
to Follenfant,<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c011'><sup>[317]</sup></a> 56,717 cases of infectious diseases occurred
among the Russians; of these 25,800 were enterorrhoea,
15,800 were typhoid fever, 8,970 were dysentery, and
4,500 were malaria. Regarding the prevalence of disease
in Port Arthur we shall have more to say in the tenth chapter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Conditions among the Japanese were less favourable, since,
on account of their rapid advance, sanitary measures could
not be carried out as extensively as was desirable. The total
number of men in the Japanese army carried away by diseases
was no less than 21,802; 3,956 succumbed to beri-beri, 4,073
to typhoid fever, 1,804 to dysentery, and 11 to typhus fever.<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c011'><sup>[318]</sup></a>
All told, 95,572 cases of beri-beri were observed; at first
the disease was very common, but later on, when barley was
added to the rice, its prevalence decreased. The number
of Japanese soldiers killed in battle was very large (47,387),
and to these must be added 10,970 who died of wounds.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to whether or not the war caused typhoid fever and
dysentery to spread among the civil inhabitants of Manchuria,
as was probably the case, we have no specific information;
the appearance of other diseases among the civil inhabitants
is improbable, since the troops would certainly have contracted
them had they been prevalent.</p>

<p class='c007'>No information has been given by either Russia or Japan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>as to whether the soldiers brought diseases back home with
them. In Japan, according to the <cite>Year Book of Statistics</cite>,<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c011'><sup>[319]</sup></a>

<p class='c007'>In order to prevent the transplantation of infectious
diseases into Japan, very comprehensive measures of precaution
were adopted by the Japanese military authorities, as
was the case after the war with China. Infected soldiers,
and soldiers suspected of being infected, were not allowed
to join the transports; in order to find them out, three
quarantine stations were established, one in Dairei (near
Moji), a second in Ninoshima (near Ujina), and a third at
Wadano Misaki (near Kobe). When the transports of troops
reached their destination, the men were divided into groups
of 60 and sent to disinfection establishments, where they were
bathed and their effects were disinfected. The sick were committed
to the hospital, and suspicious cases were quartered
in barracks under observation. If infected men had been
found on a ship, the entire ship, crew, and officers, were disinfected.
The disinfection establishments received 828,376
men for examination; of these 429,962 were disinfected.<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c011'><sup>[320]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>5. The Occupation of Tripoli by the Italians (1911)</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>During the battles fought in connexion with the occupation
of Tripoli by the Italians, infectious diseases were confined
within narrow limits. According to Sforza, the army physician
in Tripoli,<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c011'><sup>[321]</sup></a> cholera broke out there in the second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>half of October 1911, reached its climax in November, and
disappeared entirely in the second half of December. The
disease was spread chiefly by dates, which had been infected
by flies; it first appeared among the native beggars, then
spread to the rest of the population, and finally to the
Italian soldiers. The pestilence raged only in Tripoli, a fact
which Sforza regards as a proof that it was not conveyed
thither by the Italians; for had this been the case, cholera
would have revealed its presence in Homs, Bengasi, Derna,
and Tobruk, in which places thousands of soldiers disembarked,
but not a single case of the disease was observed. Typhus
fever is endemic in Tripoli; after the Italian occupation
twenty cases of that disease were observed among the natives
and ten cases among the soldiers. In order to prevent
diseases from spreading to Italy, convalescents were not
allowed to return home until there was absolutely no danger
of their communicating the infection to other persons. The
same measures of precaution were used in relation to relapsing
fever.</p>

in Mecca and Tiberias, and where it had made its appearance

<p class='c007'>Among the Bulgarians cholera did not become very widespread;
throughout the entire territory occupied by the
Bulgarians, cases of cholera, to be sure, were observed,
particularly along the Tchatalja lines. But the Bulgarians
fought the pestilence with energetic measures; the troops
were given nothing but boiled water, and careful attention
was paid to what they ate; the railway dépôts were thoroughly
disinfected, as were all places in which large numbers of
people congregated. During the armistice the Bulgarians
were forbidden all intercourse with the Turks. For the troops
transported back home quarantine stations were established.
The result of all these precautionary measures was eminently
successful. In Bulgaria itself only sporadic outbreaks of
cholera occurred, as in Sofia, Stara Zagara, and in the
district of Shumla;<a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c011'><sup>[323]</sup></a> on January 18, 1913, Bulgaria was
entirely free from cholera.</p>

<p class='c007'>Typhus fever broke out very frequently in all the armies,
but detailed information regarding its prevalence has not
been published. According to the reports which have thus far
been issued, the disease did not appear in the form of epidemics
in any of the armies; on the other hand, it is stated
that it broke out among the Turkish prisoners in Bulgaria and
Servia, as in Tatar-Bazarjik, Ligotin, Zajecar, and Kujazevas.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER X<br /> <span class='large'>EPIDEMICS IN BESIEGED STRONGHOLDS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>When fortified cities are subjected to a long siege the
death-rate in them increases considerably; if diseases break
out during the siege, they spread beyond expectation and
carry away large numbers of people. The greatest enemy of
the people in a besieged city is hunger. Since the approaching
hostile army causes the inhabitants of the surrounding
country to take refuge in the cities, the latter suddenly
become overcrowded, moreover with people who are generally
quite penniless and have to be provided for by the rest. In
former years, when warfare was much more cruel than it is to-day,
this was especially the case. Furthermore, the size of the
garrison must be rapidly increased, or perhaps the whole of
a retreating army, as was the case in Metz, must be quartered
in the stronghold. Accordingly, the first step taken by the
commander of a fortress must be to ascertain the quantity
of provisions on hand, and to work out an appropriate plan
for the distribution of them. How the quality of the bread
becomes more and more unsatisfactory, and finally reaches
the point where the product is scarcely worthy of the name
bread; how people are obliged to eat the flesh of horses,
dogs, and other animals; how the prices of the necessaries
of life soar <em>ad infinitum</em>—all this is so well known that it
needs no further exposition. Besides the absence of these
necessaries of life, the lack of milk, fats, salt, and vegetables
is accompanied by various consequences; very frequently
improper and badly prepared food gives rise to a large number
of severe cases of intestinal catarrh.</p>

<p class='c007'>Insufficient nourishment is seldom the direct cause of
death; on the other hand, it frequently so weakens people
that they are much more subject to sickness, or, if they have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>already contracted some disease, they are much more likely
to die, or, if they recover, to convalesce slowly. Thus Vacher<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c011'><sup>[324]</sup></a>
states that typhoid fever, which usually results fatally in
one out of four cases, during the siege of Paris carried away
no less than forty per cent of those who contracted it;
tuberculosis, he says, often acquired an acute form and
caused death within a few weeks. Little children present
slight resistance to famine. ‘In regard to new-born and
one-year-old infants I have observed in certain cases that
become more frequent every day, that the effects of insufficient
alimentation show themselves in the form of a progressive
emaciation, which includes all the tissues of the body and
almost always has fatal consequences; oedema of the teguments,
anaemia, uncontrollable diarrhoea, and continual
plaintive crying on the part of the little patients are the
characteristic symptoms of that hunger-fever which actually
decimates our infant generation.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Another result of insufficient nourishment, one which has
frequently been observed in besieged strongholds, is the
appearance of scurvy.</p>

<p class='c007'>During sieges, the hygienic measures of precaution, which
are absolutely essential to the maintenance of health in
cities, can no longer be carried out. If spring-water is secured
outside the city for the inhabitants, the besiegers cut off the
source of supply; if the water of rivers is used, then filtration
plants have to be erected. But even filtration does not
prevent the appearance of those infectious diseases the germs
of which are carried in water, since for washing purposes
the river-water is used just as it is found. The removal of
refuse constitutes an extremely difficult problem; the
cleaning out of privies is often possible only to a very insufficient
extent, especially when the besiegers have advanced
very close to the city, and the failure to dispose of garbage
necessarily causes large accumulations of dirt and filth in
the streets; this was especially the case in former times.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>The burying of so many dead bodies, of both men and
animals, especially horses, has met in many sieges with serious
obstacles;<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c011'><sup>[325]</sup></a> if the ditches intended for a large number of
bodies are not dug deep enough, the atmosphere becomes
polluted; to burn them is impossible, owing to lack of fuel;
and if they are cast into the river, this jeopardizes the health
of those living further downstream. During certain sieges
in the past, hard conditions have made it necessary to leave
corpses and carcases lying in the open, with terrible consequences.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the siege takes place in the winter, it is very difficult to
procure fuel for heating purposes, unless sufficient provision
has been made beforehand. In Paris, for example, the
inhabitants suffered severely from cold, and to meet the
emergency artificial fuel was prepared by mixing stable
manure with tar and reducing the mass to solid form under
the hydraulic press.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the following pages we discuss a few sieges which were
characterized by severe outbreaks of pestilence.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c012'>1. <span class='sc'>The Siege of Mantua</span> (1796–7)<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c011'><sup>[326]</sup></a></h3>

<p class='c013'>During the siege of Mantua, which the French carried on
from May 30, 1796, to February 3, 1797, war-pestilences
raged with fearful severity among both besiegers and besieged.
The city lay in an extremely unhealthy region—malaria
was ever prevalent and the drinking-water was bad. The
intentional flooding of the region and the great heat of the
summer of 1796 caused malaria to break out with great
severity and to acquire virulent forms that rendered the
disease more dangerous than usual. In the latter part of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>May 1796, the garrison consisted of 18,000 Austrian troops,
whose power of resistance had been greatly reduced by hard
service from November on, and by exposure to rain and cold
with inadequate means of shelter. Besides intermittent
fever, both intestinal catarrh and typhus fever made their
appearance in July; the latter, at least, was probably the
‘nervous fever’ mentioned by Stegmeyer. Thus as early
as the latter part of July there were some 2,000 sick men in
the garrison. In August the investment was not yet complete,
so that the soldiers did not suffer from lack of food.
Notwithstanding this fact, however, the diseases increased in
prevalence and caused many deaths; the number of sick men
was no less than 6,000. On September 12 the Austrian general,
Würmser, with about 12,000 men, succeeded in gaining
entrance into the city; he brought with him a large number
of disabled men who had been wounded in recent fighting,
and many of whom succumbed to tetanus and hospital fever.
The number of patients now increased to 8,500; as there
was no bedding or straw available, the patients were compelled
to lie on the bare ground, and the uncleanliness of the
hospitals grew worse. When the investment was finally
rendered complete in October, it caused a great scarcity of
meat, fat, and wine; the number of patients that month
was 9,000 and the number of deaths 2,560. These figures,
however, are not complete, since they do not include the
patients in the houses set aside for troops overcome by
exhaustion. Up to this time the weather had been good, but
in November rain set in; and while intermittent fever then
decreased in prevalence, dysentery raged even more furiously,
and typhus fever also broke out in a virulent, quickly fatal
form. The supply of food now ran very low, and although
there was sufficient bread on hand, horse-flesh was the only
meat. To add to the general misery, scurvy made its appearance
in November, and all those who contracted it died.
The extreme cold compelled the patients to keep their
clothes on, and they lay without blankets on the hard floors of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>the hospital corridors; their number had now increased
to 9,500, and 2,400 died in November. In December the
misery increased; the cold became more and more intense,
the supply of food was almost exhausted, and the wine gave
out altogether; scurvy raged in an even more severe and
virulent form, being frequently accompanied by copious
hemorrhages from various parts of the body. In the hospitals
there were 7,354 patients, and 2,021 died in the month of
December. In January the acme of misery was reached;
the scarcity of food was terrible, and the ravages of scurvy
were no less than frightful; 1,968 men in the garrison were
carried away in the course of that month. On February 3,
1797, the stronghold was surrendered to the French. The
number of patients taken in by the hospitals between September
and January exceeded 40,000, and of the garrison,
which numbered some 30,000 men, 10,249 (more than one-third
of the total) died. Fodéré estimates the total number
of deaths in the city of Mantua during the siege at 20,000;<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c011'><sup>[327]</sup></a>
regarding the prevalence of diseases and the number of deaths
among the civil inhabitants Steegmeyer unfortunately gives
us no information.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c012'>2. <span class='sc'>The Siege of Danzig</span> (1813)</h3>

<p class='c013'>Danzig, which in the spring of 1807 had passed through
a siege of ten weeks, was once more, in the year 1813, from
January 11 to November 29, subjected to the horrors of
a siege, which for two reasons was even more horrible than
the previous one; in the first place, the garrison was badly
infected with disease, causing a severe epidemic to rage
throughout the city; and in the second place, the defenders
of the stronghold, which was most advantageously located
to withstand a siege, were national enemies of the inhabitants.
Consequently the latter were not only grossly disregarded
in the distribution of supplies, but were actually obliged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>to turn over all they had to the French and then buy it back
at exorbitant prices. And while the inhabitants, and toward
the end of the siege the soldiers, too, suffered severely from
a lack of the necessaries of life, the higher officers and the
military officials lived in luxury until the day of the surrender.</p>

<p class='c007'>Napoleon had assigned the defence of the city to General
Rapp, who performed the task with great valour and ability.
On the return march from Russia, some 40,000 men of Macdonald’s
corps had congregated in Danzig, and 5,000 of them
were sent away by Rapp; in the middle of January the total
number of men in the garrison, including the military
officials, was 35,934, consisting of Frenchmen, Poles, Bavarians,
Westphalians, Spaniards, Italians, and Dutchmen. While
Macdonald’s corps had fared pretty well, comparatively
speaking, in the Russian campaign, the men were all very
much exhausted, and furthermore, typhus fever was prevalent
among them. As early as the latter part of January,
accordingly, the number of sick soldiers was very large;
in fact, only about 10,000 men were healthy and able to
bear arms. ‘As there were no hospitals, beds, or remedies,’
says Friccius,<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c011'><sup>[328]</sup></a> ‘many died from lack of care, and at the same
time infectious diseases broke out and made great havoc.
A heap of dead men and horses was a common sight in the
streets, and in a short time many thousands of the troops,
as well as of the inhabitants, were carried away.’</p>

<p class='c007'>In January the death-rate remained comparatively low;
of the garrison about 400 men died in the course of that
month. But in February, which was a very cold month,
typhus fever spread abroad with great rapidity, so that
toward the end of the month some 130 soldiers died every
day; no less than 15,000 men lay sick, and the total number
of deaths for the entire month amounted to 2,000. When it
began to thaw on February 24, the number of patients and
deaths increased still more, so that 4,000 men died in March
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>and 3,000 in April. From April on, the condition of health
in the garrison improved, although the number of deaths
in the month of May was still no less than 2,000.<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c011'><sup>[329]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>As early as February typhus fever had spread to the civil
population, which before the siege had numbered some
40,000; a great many civilians, however, had fled from the
city before the investment was yet complete. In the months
of February and March, according to Blech,<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c011'><sup>[330]</sup></a> some 200–300
persons died every week, ‘including representatives of all
classes—physicians, preachers, jurists, merchants, down to
the humblest people.’ The pestilence raged most furiously
among the civil inhabitants in the latter part of March.
‘Almost every family was in mourning, and many families
were wiped out entirely; the best and most estimable
young men were carried away in the prime of their lives.
Whole families perished, especially in certain streets which
the pestilence seemed to have selected for its chief dwelling-place.’<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c011'><sup>[331]</sup></a>
These were especially the streets inhabited by the
poorer classes.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not long before a lack of the necessaries of life
began to make itself felt in the city. As early as February 27
the Russians had cut off the supply of water afforded by the
Radaune, which fed the wells in the city, and this necessitated
dependence upon rain-water. For the purpose of obtaining
new supplies of food, a sortie along the Nehrung was undertaken
on April 27; and while the enterprise was successful, the only
persons who really derived any benefit from it were the higher
officers and military officials, who sold butter, milk, and
corned beef at exorbitant prices. Thus the well-to-do citizens,
at least, were able to secure food by paying an excessive
price for it. In May the conditions among the poor became
a great deal worse; they were obliged to eat things that were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>positively disgusting; horse-meat and waste from the
breweries were delicacies, while cats and dogs were also
devoured. The rations of the soldiers grew smaller and
smaller, although there was sufficient grain on hand to keep
them supplied with bread. Says Friccius,<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c011'><sup>[332]</sup></a> in regard to a
sortie undertaken on June 9, ‘How hungry the troops in the
garrison were is indicated by the fact that they cut up every
horse that was killed in battle and took the edible parts
with them.’</p>

<p class='c007'>After the conclusion of the armistice, which became
known in Danzig on June 10, there was a pause in the siege
lasting until August 18; during this time the besiegers
brought food to the garrison every five days, but absolutely
no provision was made for the civil inhabitants. During the
armistice many citizens left the city; indeed the French
expelled from the city all persons who were not sufficiently
provided with the necessaries of life. At first the Russians
allowed the fugitives to pass through their lines, but later
on they raised objections, so that a large number of the
unfortunate inhabitants were obliged to live in the open
fields between the besiegers and the besieged, where many
of them died of starvation. In the latter part of September
General Rapp allowed some 300 of them, who had managed
to keep alive, to return into the city. Blech asserts that the
emigration of beggars and others of the poor reduced the
population of the city by some 16,000.<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c011'><sup>[333]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In October, lack of the necessaries of life reached a climax,
so that rats and mice were eaten. Since the scarcity of
provender made it necessary to slaughter almost all the horses,
the soldiers were supplied with large quantities of horse-meat.
On November 1 the granaries, in which were kept the
provisions of the garrison, were destroyed by fire, resulting
in the loss of about two-thirds of the provisions. This made
it necessary to reduce the soldiers’ bread-rations, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>bread with which they were supplied was made of half-burned
flour and of rusks fished out of the stinking Mottlau;
‘it was so disgusting that only ravenous hunger could induce
anybody to eat it.’<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c011'><sup>[334]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In consequence of hunger and the unnatural food eaten,
the mortality among the civil inhabitants, the number of
whom had dwindled down to 16,000, became very high; the
number of deaths per week in the month of October was no
less than 50–80, to which, according to Blech, must be
added the deaths among the poor which were no longer
reported. In the first part of November there were some
80–90 deaths per week. On November 29 General Rapp
surrendered the city to the Russians and Prussians; but
since the conditions of capitulation could not be agreed
upon until January 1, 1814, there was an interval of about
a month during which the French garrison, but not the civil
population, was supplied with food; consequently the death-rate
among the citizens remained high. Furthermore, the
besiegers, among whom a virulent typhus had been raging
since October, communicated the infection to the inhabitants,
107 of whom succumbed to it in the last week of November,
133 in the first week of December, and 138 in the following
week. On December 1, permission was obtained to establish
a market, and from that time on, the citizens could once more
provide themselves with food in a regular way.</p>

<p class='c007'>The loss of human life inside the besieged stronghold was
terrible; of the 35,900 troops in the garrison, 15,736 according
to Friccius died in the lazarets; at the time of the capitulation
only 16,532 men were left, and of these 1,482 were sick
and had to be left in the city. According to Blech, a total
of 5,592 civilians died, 1,142 of them in the last three months
(October-December) of the year; the number of deaths in
December alone was 473. Toward the end of the siege some
ninety persons died of starvation.<a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c011'><sup>[335]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c012'>3. <span class='sc'>The Siege of Torgau</span> (1813)<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c011'><sup>[336]</sup></a></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>On May 10, 1813, when Napoleon had appeared in Saxony,
and the King, after considerable hesitation, had decided in
his favour, the Saxon garrison of Torgau, at that time a place
of 5,000 inhabitants, was replaced by a French army-corps.
In the course of the summer large transports of sick soldiers
from various lazarets arrived at Torgau, and on July 18
alone 3,000 sick men and 1,000 convalescents came from
Dresden. Consequently the number of sick in the stronghold
was very large even before the siege began; all public
buildings had been converted into lazarets. But even these
were not numerous or large enough to accommodate all the
patients, who numbered some 6,000 in the month of September,
so that the occupants of houses along entire streets
were driven out of their homes, which were used for lazarets
and barracks. ‘A virulent, putrid fever’ raged in all the
lazarets, and at least one-third of the persons who contracted
it died; the inhabitants and the Frenchmen quartered in
the homes of citizens were at first spared by the disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the battle of Dennewitz (September 6, 1813) the
head-quarters of the third and fourth French army-corps was
transferred to Torgau, where also numerous fugitives took
refuge; at the same time the large French head-quarters
from Dresden arrived, so that the size of the garrison was
increased by 10,000 men and 5,000 horses. After the battle
of Leipzig the stronghold was besieged by the Prussians,
and presently the supply of food ran low and the uncleanliness
in the streets and houses grew incredibly worse. ‘Then the
pestilence began to spread at an alarming rate among
the inhabitants and among the Frenchmen quartered in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>homes of citizens, so that the entire city of Torgau came to
resemble a large, overcrowded lazaret.’<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c011'><sup>[337]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>‘The regular lazarets now became veritable hot-beds of
misery; they were scarcely able to accommodate the large
number of patients, who numbered at least 12,000, and whom
it was necessary to place so close together that they almost
touched one another. There was a lack of straw and of
other necessities, of sick-attendants and physicians, of
effective remedies, and especially of order and proper
superintendence.’ The patients suffered partly from severe,
fetid diarrhoea, and partly from typhus. In the courtyards
there were enormous accumulations of dirt and refuse, and
the doors leading into many of the sick-rooms could scarcely
be opened owing to the collections of foul matter which
covered the floor ankle-deep; in order to reach the sick it
was necessary to wade through this and to climb over dead
bodies. Absolutely no thought was given to keeping the
rooms warm. ‘Thus it is quite natural that among these
horrible surroundings the slightest wound, the most insignificant
indisposition, could easily have a fatal termination,
and that it was like sentencing a man to death to bring him
to the lazaret.’ The number of deaths exceeded 8,000 in the
month of November alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>Equally terrible were the conditions in the other parts of
the city; all the private houses were overcrowded with
patients and filled with dirt. A sickening odour permeated the
atmosphere; in the ditches around the fortress and in every
corner of the city lay dead horses, rotting straw sacks, ragged
uniforms, and even human corpses. Refuse of the worst
kind was piled up in the streets, often as high as the second
story. ‘At this time’, says Lehmann, ‘Torgau looked more
like a lazaret than a city inhabited by healthy persons; for
who would have been able to find a house in which there were
no persons suffering from nerve-fever? Parlours, bedrooms,
halls, stables, kitchens, and cellars—all were filled with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>patients.’ The barracks and guard-rooms resembled hospitals.
In a few weeks more than 600 inhabitants died; entire families
were wiped out by the epidemic, and there was scarcely one
which was not mourning the loss of one of its members.</p>

<p class='c007'>Up to the beginning of December the number of patients
steadily increased; in the lazarets alone, 300 soldiers died
every day.</p>

<p class='c007'>The terrors of the bombardment had a very disastrous
effect upon the inhabitants of the city, since it compelled
them to live in damp, unhealthy, infected cellars. Not until
the latter part of December did the epidemic begin to abate
and to lose, at the same time, its virulent character; the
arrival of very cold weather, as well as the diminution of
the number of people, and the fact that the infection had
practically run its course among the inhabitants and the
garrison, were at least partly responsible for this abatement;
furthermore, there was now less crowding, and it became
possible to establish better order.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lack of system in the French lazarets is shown by the
fact that the authorities were never once able to give an
account of the number of persons that died in them. From
grave-diggers’ records and church registers Richter managed
to compile the following table of statistics indicating the
number of deaths:<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c011'><sup>[338]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>According to this table there died, between September
and January 10, 19,654 French soldiers, 103 Saxon soldiers,
and 678 civilians. But Richter says in regard to the above
figures: ‘There is no doubt, however, that the figures
pertaining to the French soldiers are much too small, since
they include only those that were actually buried by the
grave-diggers in public burial-grounds. All those who died
in private houses, in the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-de-pont</span></i>, in the various forts,
in the lunettes, or in any of the outworks of the fortress are
not included; their number was by no means small, and many
of them were buried unceremoniously by citizens or by their
comrades, while large numbers of bodies were left lying in
the open.’ In the month of May it was impossible to find
a grave-digger to bury the heaps of corpses, which were
consequently thrown in masses into the Elbe; this of course
interfered with the operation of the floating mills along the
river. Nor are the bodies disposed of in this way included
in the above table. Accordingly, Richter estimates the total
number of deaths among the French soldiers at between
29,000 and 30,000 men.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pestilence continued to rage even after the surrender
of the stronghold, and did not begin to abate until the latter
part of January. Although the Prussian troops were not
quartered in the city, and entered it only in the day-time,
the pestilence nevertheless spread to them and carried away
more than 300 men in the course of three months. Not
until the end of February did the pestilence among the civil
inhabitants begin to abate; the mortality was still high in
March, but in April it sank to normal again.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to Richter, two-thirds of the patients in the
military lazaret were suffering from ‘colliquative, dysenteric
diarrhoea’, and only one-third from ‘true typhus’, whereas
among the civil inhabitants the latter was by far the more
common. There were two forms of diarrhoea observed; it
appeared either as an acute attack of dysentery, which rarely
lasted longer than two weeks and then terminated in either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>death or recovery, or else as a chronic, dysenteric diarrhoea,
which caused general weakness and finally death.</p>

<p class='c007'>Typhus fever began always with a frequently recurring chill,
and with a violent headache and general indisposition; this
was followed by a stage of dry fever, accompanied by stupor,
dizziness, and often wild delirium; as a rule the first few days
were characterized by obstinate constipation, and bleeding
at the nose was very common. Later on, somnolence manifested
itself, and the original constipation changed to a copious,
fetid diarrhoea. Petechiae appeared frequently, but not
invariably; at first small, bright-red spots showed themselves,
and later on they assumed a darker colour, grew larger, and
finally turned black. Their size varied considerably; sometimes
they were the size of a pin-head, while often they were
from one to one-and-a-half centimetres in diameter. Most
of the patients died between the tenth and fifteenth days;
but if the disease progressed favourably, signs of improvement
usually showed themselves suddenly on the fourteenth or
fifteenth day; as a rule, convalescence was of short duration.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two forms of ‘nerve-fever’ mentioned by Richter
doubtless include various other diseases. That many cases
of typhus fever were among the fever patients may be inferred
from the fact that the disease was very prevalent among
the French troops, and also from Richter’s description; he
expressly mentions the sudden appearance of the disease, the
initial chill, the remission of the fever in the third week,
and the rapid convalescence—all of them characteristic signs
of typhus fever. Moreover, typhoid fever doubtless prevailed
more or less extensively. Richter describes ‘a pituitous
modification of typhus’, with a lingering development;<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c011'><sup>[339]</sup></a>
the crisis always came late, frequently not until the sixth or
seventh week, and was invariably uncertain, so that convalescence
was very slow and often interrupted by relapses.
Deuteropathic complications were of almost regular occurrence.
There can be no doubt that we have to do here with a good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>description of typhoid fever, which revealed its presence
chiefly among the newly-conscripted young French soldiers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Regarding the enormous loss of life caused by the epidemic
in Torgau, Richter, who was a Prussian military physician,
says: ‘The devastation that it caused among the Frenchmen,
and unfortunately among the inhabitants of the ill-fated
city as well, was indeed terrible; in fact there is happily
scarcely a parallel to it in the history of the world. One may
safely say that the misery experienced by the French troops
throughout the entire course of that disastrous war reached
its climax inside the walls of Torgau. The French lazarets
in the city represented scenes of horror such as repel human
nature, and such as one must actually witness in order to
appreciate fully their dreadfulness.’</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>4. The Siege of Mayence (1813–14)</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>The terrible devastation caused by typhus fever in the
strongholds along the Vistula, Elbe, and Rhine, which were
so valorously defended by French generals in the years
1813–14, excited general consternation. Wittmann<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c011'><sup>[340]</sup></a> furnishes
a very accurate description of the misery undergone in
the besieged cities, especially the city of Mayence. First
he comments on the scarcity of supplies, observing that the
vicissitudes of war can never be foreseen; furthermore, he
asserts that the commanders of fortresses, when they anticipated
a siege, purposely kept the inhabitants in uncertainty
about it. In the case of Mayence, Napoleon ordered the
city to be provisioned after the battle of Leipzig. Some
2,000 oxen were collected, and most of them were kept
in the villages surrounding Mayence; but when the Allies
crossed the Rhine the oxen were all quickly driven into
the city, where they grew lean owing to lack of provender,
and died of rinderpest in such large numbers that it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>became necessary to slaughter them all and salt the meat.
This was done in such a careless way that a large part of the
meat was spoiled; even after the stronghold surrendered,
some of this salted meat was still on hand, and it was so
rotten that it had to be destroyed. The citizens had learned
of the danger too late, and numerous unscrupulous citizens
bought up all the important necessaries of life and then took
advantage of the situation by raising the prices so high that
only the wealthy could procure food. Lack of good bread,
which had been so scarce during the previous siege of Mayence
(1793), does not seem to have been so severely felt in the
siege of 1813. Particularly noticeable was the want of fuel,
so that many soldiers froze to death in the exposed guard-rooms
of the outworks. Legumes, especially peas, could not
be thoroughly cooked, so that it was frequently necessary
to throw them away. The supply of good fat, as well as of
fresh vegetables, soon ran out, while the great quantity of
alcoholic beverages stored up in Mayence had a very detrimental
effect. Very inadequate provision was made for the
sheltering of the soldiers; inasmuch as the siege took place
in the winter, they could not camp in the open, and the barracks
were not large or numerous enough to accommodate
them. Consequently the officers were quartered in the homes
of the wealthier citizens, one officer in each house, while the
troops were housed in large numbers in the often insanitary
homes of the poorer people. This of course greatly favoured
the dissemination of infectious diseases.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to Wittmann, there was not a single trace of
an infectious disease in Mayence in September 1813. In
October the field-lazarets of the army were transferred from
Leipzig to the West, and most of them passed through
Mayence; in the first part of November, moreover, the field-army
itself passed through the city on its return march; thus
sick and healthy soldiers conveyed typhus fever into the
stronghold. ‘In the vicinity of the hospitals and churches,
where sick soldiers were congregated, in the streets through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>which these doomed victims passed, and in the houses in
which they were quartered together with healthy men, or
into which they had crept from sheer inability to go further,
contagious typhus broke out first and with the greatest
severity.’<a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c011'><sup>[341]</sup></a> Dr. Petit, the commissary sent out by the
government in Paris, did not have the courage to oppose
the will of Marshal Marmont, who was in chief command,
and so he sought to pacify the inhabitants by means of
notices in the papers to the effect that the prevailing disease
was neither epidemic nor infectious, and was only contagious
typhus.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the investment was complete, typhus fever caused
terrible devastation throughout the city. When the siege
began, Mayence had a garrison of some 30,000 men, while
the civil inhabitants numbered about 24,500; to the latter,
however, must be added a considerable number of refugees
from the surrounding country. The bad hospital arrangements,
as always happened at that time, greatly helped to
spread the disease in Mayence. According to a report made
out by two French physicians and reproduced by Wittmann,
the air in the hospitals was terrible; every bed was occupied
by two patients, while the straw under them and the blankets
over them were never changed or washed, so that they must
necessarily have constituted a source of infection. A report
by Kerckhoffs<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c011'><sup>[342]</sup></a> regarding the Mayence hospitals describes
even worse conditions:</p>

<p class='c024'>I was appointed to serve in the hospital established in the Municipal
Octroi Building, and the first time that I went there I found the
living and the dead, the wounded and the sick, scattered in confusion
all over the place. The sick were stretched out on the floor, without
even straw under them, covered with ordure. I was obliged to pick
my way on tip-toe in order not to sink up to the ankles in filth.
I saw sick men lying beside the dead bodies of their comrades.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>In effect, there were so many of them that they were lying on top of
one another. In some of the rooms the windows were closed, so that
no air could enter; in other rooms there was neither glass nor
boarding in the doors or windows, notwithstanding the extreme
cold. The sick men told me that they had been in that same position
for two, three, and even four days, without having had a drop of
water.</p>

<p class='c006'>The soldiers under arrest, who were compelled to clean
out the hospitals, all died, no more sick-attendants were to
be found, and a large number of physicians perished in the
performance of their duties; all the persons employed in
the hospital entirely neglected their duties, and most of
them were drunk all the time, since large quantities of wine
were on hand for the patients.</p>

<p class='c007'>The result was that the epidemic gradually attained to
enormous dimensions. ‘The infection’, says Wittmann,<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c011'><sup>[343]</sup></a>
‘carried away all the grave-diggers one by one, and it was
impossible to find anybody who was willing to do that dangerous
work. Thousands of dead bodies of citizens and soldiers
lay for weeks in front of the Münstertor, where they were
piled up like logs pending burial.’ In December and January
the epidemic reached its climax; after that it gradually
abated, but did not come to an end until May 3, 1814, when
the siege terminated and the Allies entered the city.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the period between November 1, 1813, and May 3, 1814,
7,000 deaths among the soldiers are recorded in the civil
register of the city; according to statements of the grave-diggers,
some 10,000 or 11,000 more soldiers were buried,
whose names were not entered in the register for the reason
that they could not be ascertained; nor do the above
figures include the number of deaths in the stronghold of
Kastel on the other side of the Rhine. Of the civil inhabitants,
2,445 (about one-tenth of the population) died; a large
number of physicians contracted the disease, and four
physicians and five surgeons succumbed to it.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>5. The Siege of Paris (1870–1)</span><a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c011'><sup>[344]</sup></a></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>After the battle of Sedan the Germans immediately began
to march toward Paris; on September 15, 1870, the first
cavalrymen appeared before the capital, and on September 19
the investment was complete.</p>

<p class='c007'>An exhaustive account by H. Sueur and a large number
of other reports offer us very full information regarding the
condition of health in Paris during the siege, since the administrative
apparatus never stopped running. The approach of
the German armies caused numerous well-to-do citizens to
leave the city; some went south, some to Switzerland, and
some to England. Sueur estimates their number from the
reports of the railroad companies at 300,000. On the other
hand, a large number of the inhabitants of the surrounding
country sought refuge in the city; their number is estimated
at 180,000. Furthermore, the size of the garrison was
considerably increased; the number of men in the regular
army on November 4, 1870, is estimated at 236,941, and this
does not include 8,000 men in the First Division of the First
Corps. To the above, moreover, must be added the number
of soldiers who died between the beginning and the end of
the siege. Thus the number of men in the regular army at
the beginning of the siege was some 246,000; of these some
56,000 were already in the city in the middle of the summer,
while the remaining 190,000 arrived later. Accordingly, the
total number of people in the city shortly before the siege
began was increased by 70,000. Legoyt estimated the population
of the city on July 1, 1870, at 1,890,000, so that on the
opening day of the investment there were 1,960,000 (in round
numbers, 2,000,000) people in Paris. The arrival of the
190,000 soldiers altered the composition of the population,
since the increase augmented only the number of males
between the ages of 20 and 40.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>A severe epidemic of small-pox raged in Paris, as stated
above, even before the siege took place. In the first part of
the siege, moreover, the disease raged with even greater
fury in the city, since most of the young newly-enlisted
mobile guards had never been vaccinated. The maximum
of deaths caused by it were reported between November 6
and November 27. We have already described the course
of the small-pox epidemic in Paris.<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c011'><sup>[345]</sup></a> It was influenced
neither by hunger nor by cold, but developed chiefly for the
reason that it was impossible to congregate and isolate the
large number of unvaccinated and susceptible persons.</p>

<p class='c007'>Typhoid fever, dysentery, and diarrhoea, because of the
unfavourable conditions brought about by the siege, became
very widespread and virulent. Whereas in the year 1869
there were 630 deaths caused by typhoid fever, during the
siege of 1870 no less than 3,475 persons succumbed to that
disease. Dupinet<a id='r346' /><a href='#f346' class='c011'><sup>[346]</sup></a> thinks that the above number is too
small, because the disease was often not recognized, and
pneumonia, a common complication, was entered as the
cause of death. Inasmuch as typhoid fever was endemic in
Paris, and as the native inhabitants had acquired immunity
by recovery from an attack in the early part of their lives,
those who were most severely afflicted by the disease were
chiefly the soldiers in the army and the refugees from the
surrounding country. The largest number of deaths was
reported in the twentieth week of the siege, i.e. between
January 14 and 20.<a id='r347' /><a href='#f347' class='c011'><sup>[347]</sup></a> No less than 375 persons succumbed
to typhoid fever in the course of that week, whereas in the
corresponding week of the previous year only sixteen deaths
had been reported. The largest number of deaths caused
by dysentery and diarrhoea in a single week was reported
somewhat later; the limited prevalence of these diseases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>during the siege is indicated by the fact that in the half-year
1869–70 the number of deaths caused by them was
never more than twenty per week. From statistics compiled
by Sueur we have arranged the following table (p. 323),
which also includes the deaths caused by bronchitis and
pneumonia, but not the victims buried on the battle-fields,
of whom there were some 3,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>The table indicates the gradual diminution of the
food-supply. In December the quality of the bread grew
worse and worse; white bread could no longer be baked,
and in its place an almost inedible form of brown bread was
made out of bran, wheat, rye, rice, barley, and oats. Particularly
noticeable was the lack of good fats, making it necessary
to prepare foods with a bad-tasting tallow that was
sold under the name of ‘Beurre de Paris’. Since the cattle
had to be slaughtered (those that were not killed died of
various diseases), there was very soon a great scarcity of
milk, making it very difficult to feed infants.<a id='r348' /><a href='#f348' class='c011'><sup>[348]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Several persons have maintained that the extreme cold
exerted considerable influence upon the death-rate; and
a glance at the two columns in the table indicating
the number of deaths caused by pneumonia and bronchitis
would seem to justify this contention. How great the
difference was, as compared with normal years, will be
obvious when we call attention to the fact that, whereas in
the twenty-second week of the siege (January 28–February 3)
627 persons succumbed to bronchitis, in the preceding year
only seventy-six deaths were caused by that disease between
January 30 and February 5, and that, whereas from 465
to 468 persons succumbed to pneumonia between January 21
and February 18, 1871, the number of deaths caused by that
disease in the corresponding period of the previous year
varied from 90 to 119 per week.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to the unanimous verdict of the Paris physicians,
typhus fever did not make its appearance during the siege.</p>

the disease to the lack of fresh vegetables, which were very

that the outbreak was caused by the lack of light and air

be found in the lack of fresh vegetables, which Grenet does
not mention.</p>

<p class='c013'>Port Arthur was besieged by the Japanese from July 30,
1904, to January 2, 1905—a period of 156 days. Whereas,
as stated in the last chapter, the condition of health in the
Russian army was good, the sanitary conditions in Port
Arthur during the siege were very bad, since the supply
of provisions that had been laid in proved to be insufficient.<a id='r351' /><a href='#f351' class='c011'><sup>[351]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>The offer made on August 16 by General Nogi and Admiral
Togo, granting all the women, children (under 16 years),
ecclesiastics, members of the diplomatic corps and military
and naval attachés of foreign powers permission to leave the
stronghold, was refused by General Stössel. As early as
August 5 horse-meat began to be distributed;<a id='r352' /><a href='#f352' class='c011'><sup>[352]</sup></a> from
September 17 on the troops were supplied four times a week
with horse-meat, since there was no other fresh or canned
meat available. At this time almost everything in the city
was consumed, though the Chinese secretly brought rice, eggs,
and other things, on boats from Chufoo. After September 28
the soldiers were given meat only twice a week (one-half of
a pound of horse-meat or one-third of a can of preserved
meat). Regarding conditions up to October 20 we are informed
by the report of the Russian General Medical Staff:<a id='r353' /><a href='#f353' class='c011'><sup>[353]</sup></a> ‘The
supply of food ran lower and lower; beef gave out very
early, only a small quantity of canned meat was left, and even
the portions of horse-meat had to be dealt out very sparingly,
as we had very important use for horses in transporting
ammunition, water, food, &amp;c., to the various positions. In
the city it became more and more difficult every day to
procure food; meat, if by any chance a small quantity was
marketed, was sold in the stores for one and one-half roubles
per pound. A chicken cost twelve roubles, a goose twenty
roubles, an egg one rouble, a pound of onions one rouble,
a pound of horse-meat one half-rouble.’</p>

<p class='c007'>In November all the soldiers were given was horse-meat;
only the sick received canned meat. The supply of food in
the possession of private individuals was exhausted, while
garlic and vegetables had given out altogether.</p>

with water; there was however another aqueduct, and,
furthermore, wells were bored and a plant for distilling seawater
was put into operation. The statement of the Russian
General Staff that there was at no time a serious scarcity of
water is not confirmed in Olga von Baumgarten’s diary,
which frequently refers in plaintive terms to the lack of
drinking-water in the lazarets.<a id='r354' /><a href='#f354' class='c011'><sup>[354]</sup></a></p>

there were 132 officers and 5,661 men in the lazarets. In
the first part of October typhoid fever broke out in Port
Arthur, where it was endemic, and before long an epidemic
of such severity was raging in the city that it was difficult
to find places in which to shelter the patients. There were
also a great many cases of dysentery. Owing to the lack of
preserved meat and vegetables, scurvy also made its appearance;
the first cases of the disease were observed early in
October. In the latter part of that month there were in the
lazarets 450 typhoid-fever patients, 855 dysentery patients,
and 167 scurvy patients. In addition to these diseases, cases
of night-blindness (inability to see after dusk) were observed;
the latter disease is quite common among Russian country-people,
being caused by bad nourishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>In December the garrison was completely exhausted.
Scurvy had become more and more widespread, and between
the fourteenth and twenty-seventh of that month 71 officers
and 1,790 men had been committed to the lazarets. On the
day of the surrender (January 2, 1905) the number of men
in the Russian garrison was 32,400, and of these 6,458 were

time of the surrender was only 12,735. Regarding the loss of
life during the siege we find no information in the report
of the General Staff. The number of soldiers in the city
(excluding the officers and officials) was 41,780 at the
beginning and 32,400 at the end of the siege. No further
information regarding the condition of health among the

  <h2 class='c005'>CONCLUSION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The history of war-pestilences has shown how severely
belligerent armies are attacked by infectious diseases, how
seriously their operations are hampered by them, and what
loss of life such diseases cause by spreading to non-combatants.
If we start from the time when more or less
accurate descriptions enable us to determine the nature of
the epidemics, we find that plague and typhus fever were the
two diseases which, until a few decades ago, most commonly
attacked the soldiers; the latter disease, which made its
appearance in almost every war that was waged between
the beginning of the sixteenth and the middle of the nineteenth
century, consequently acquired the name ‘war-plague’.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a long time nobody knew just how to combat these
pestilences, and nowhere were rational measures adopted
aiming to prevent them from spreading. We have seen the
bitter truth of this statement in connexion with the endless
Napoleonic wars. One reason for the neglect of preventive
measures was the belief that these pestilences broke out
spontaneously when large numbers were crowded together
under miserable living conditions. The physicians of that
time, in their efforts to explain the sudden appearance of
these pestilences, arrived at the conclusion that they were
autochthonic. But modern medical science, realizing its
limitations, contents itself with the hypothesis that the
original cause of these diseases is not to be ascertained, and
with the knowledge that the infective agents in the case
of almost all of them have been discovered, and that an
outbreak of any infectious disease in any specific locality
signifies that the germ of that disease must in some way have
been deposited there. It was precisely the belief in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>spontaneous origination of pestilences that led people to
neglect watching for and isolating, with all possible dispatch,
the first cases—a measure which is to-day looked upon as the
most important means of preventing the dissemination of
a disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>The belief in the autochthonic origin of diseases continued
to prevail until the first half of the nineteenth century.
Hecker upheld it in a discussion of the plague-epidemic that
occurred during the Russo-Turkish War of 1769–70; he
believed that the intermittent fever prevalent in the Danube
countries passed over into putrid fever, with or without
petechiae, that carbuncles and buboes gradually developed,
and that putrid fever was thus converted into bubonic plague.
‘It is therefore in all probability true’, says Hecker, ‘that
the outbreak of plague in the Russian army in the year 1770,
as well as in the year 1828, was not caused by direct infection
from the Turkish troops, but was merely an independent
development from intermittent fever and spotted fever.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Recent investigations in the field of medicine turn over to
the other sciences all questions regarding ultimate causes,
and confine themselves to what is actually observed. We
know that the agents responsible for infectious diseases are
specific minute organisms which must be present in the
system to produce the disease in question, and that these
micro-organisms are conveyed from place to place by infected
persons, by intermediaries, on articles to which they have
attached themselves, in contaminated food, in drinking-water,
and in many other ways. Investigators have studied
the conditions in which these infective agents live and the
manner in which they are disseminated, they have discovered
methods of determining the nature of the disease in a very
short time, and they have come to recognize the danger of
coming in contact with germ-bearers, that is, with persons,
healthy or convalescent, who have these micro-organisms in
their systems without being themselves sick. Medical science
is now endeavouring, by means of systematic procedure and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>splendid organization, to guard soldiers against the danger
of infection; good drinking-water is provided, the men and
the rooms in which they live are kept clean, persons suffering
from infectious diseases are isolated, all rooms and articles
used by patients are disinfected, infected divisions of troops
are quartered by themselves, germ-bearers are watched for
and discovered, &amp;c. The success of such measures is well
known. The knowledge gained and profited by in times of
peace is also applied in times of war, and to-day we are able
to confine pestilences within much narrower limits than was
formerly possible. In order to do this, however, we must
have, in addition to an efficient system of transporting and
feeding troops, physicians who are well informed in regard
to hygiene and bacteriology.</p>

<p class='c007'>As early as the eighteenth century, successful efforts were
made to prevent, by means of energetic measures, the
reappearance of plague in Europe; the Russo-Turkish War
of 1828–9 was the last war in which it broke out. On the
other hand, typhus fever continued to be the Nemesis of
belligerent armies, while a new infectious disease, cholera,
entered upon the scene and played a very important rôle in
the Crimean War, and a by no means minor rôle in the war
of 1866. Along with these diseases, typhoid fever advanced
into the foreground about the middle of the last century,
and it soon turned out to be one of the most dangerous
diseases that occur among soldiers. This appearance of
typhoid fever has led some to think that the disease has
prevailed extensively only in comparatively recent times.
Hirsch, however, ably defends the opposite view; he maintains
that typhoid fever was in many instances confused
with the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>febres pestilentes</em>, <em>malignae</em>, <em>putridae</em></span>, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>nervosae</em></span>,
with the mucous fevers, bilious fevers, putrid fevers, &amp;c.
In discussing the typhus-fever epidemics that occurred in the
course of the Napoleonic wars, we have several times called
attention to the fact that typhoid fever probably broke out
in the form of epidemics; but it could be diagnosed with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>certainty only after post-mortem examinations began to be
more frequent. At all events, typhoid fever is to-day prevalent
all over the world, and there is always danger that field-armies
will be infected with it, either in their own land or in
the land of the enemy. All the wars of the last few decades
have clearly demonstrated this fact.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a successful battle against war-pestilences, it is a fortunate
coincidence that the civil as well as the military authorities
are equally interested in their prevention. Every
military leader knows how important it is for the soldiers to
keep healthy, since their efficiency is otherwise seriously
impaired. It is not our task to describe the particular
measures that are to be adopted; the manuals of military
sanitation give us accurate information regarding these
matters. We merely mention the fact that it is of great
value and importance to have physicians, who are well
acquainted with hygienic problems, make a preliminary
examination of sanitary conditions in the territory through
which the soldiers will be required to pass in order to reach
the scene of hostilities.</p>

<p class='c007'>Very great difficulties, to be sure, confront the efforts
made in war times to prevent the outbreak of infectious
diseases. If the struggle is carried on in an infected region,
the troops are often compelled to seek shelter in infected
houses; thus during the battles of Orléans and Le Mans in
the Franco-German War the troops, in order to protect
themselves against the severe winter cold, had to live in
houses which small-pox patients had shortly before occupied
or were actually occupying at the time. Circumstances
frequently arise which render impossible the adoption of the
most effective measure calculated to prevent the dissemination
of a pestilence, that is, the isolation of infected divisions
of troops; one can readily imagine how difficult this would
be in the case of an army re-forming after a lost battle.
Furthermore, even if one of the belligerent armies is doing
all it can to prevent diseases from spreading, its efforts must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>be seriously handicapped if the enemy’s army does not
include an equally diligent sanitary corps and does not devote
the same amount of energy to the prevention of the outbreak
and dissemination of infectious diseases. For even if a sanitary
corps is successful in warding off a reaction upon its own
troops, nevertheless this reaction is sure to take place with
respect to the civil inhabitants of the country in which the
war is waged.</p>

<p class='c007'>During a war, the civil authorities must also do their part
in preventing diseases from spreading to the civil population.
The local administrations of a region in which fighting is
going on are powerless. The generals care very little whether
or not a city or village in the enemy’s country is infected
by their troops, whom they quarter in whatever house or
place best suits their purpose. On the other hand, the communities
in which military prisons are located are confronted
with a very difficult problem, since these prisons, if infected
men are confined in them, easily develop into centres of
infection; this fact was observed a hundred times in the
year 1870. If a disease breaks out in a community in consequence
of the fact that a military prison has been established
there, in my opinion it is incumbent on the central government
of the country to support the local authorities in their
efforts to check the disease, and to give them financial help
as well as scientific advice. Unfortunately, it is not to be
denied that, in many small cities and in almost all rural
communities, absolutely no provision is made for the isolation
of persons suffering from infectious diseases; the authorities
justify themselves with the reflection that in case of emergency
barracks can quickly be erected for the purpose, but at the
same time they fail to remember that working-men are not
always available in the storm and stress of war times, that
building materials in the general scarcity of supplies cannot
always be procured with sufficient promptitude, and that
pestilences, if the isolation of the first cases is delayed, usually
spread with great rapidity.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>In future wars we must expect the military authorities to
do all they can, just as soon as the prisoners are taken,
to segregate as carefully as possible all known and suspected
cases of infectious diseases. The difficulties confronting the
military authorities, when it is necessary to remove large
numbers of prisoners with all possible dispatch away from
the scene of the war, are, to be sure, very great.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, we must also call attention to the danger to which
the civil inhabitants of a country are exposed, when the
soldiers return home after the termination of a campaign in
an infected region. It must be demanded under all circumstances
that divisions of troops among whom infectious
diseases have made their appearance, before returning from
the enemy’s country, shall be subjected to a medical examination,
isolated, and disinfected, just as was done on such
a large scale, for example, by the Japanese after the wars
with China and Russia. This also applies to all other persons
who have had anything to do with infected divisions, particularly
to teamsters.</p>

<p class='c007'>All preparations designed to prevent the outbreak and
dissemination of infectious diseases must be made in times
of peace; barracks and lazarets must be erected, physicians
who are well acquainted with methods of hygienic investigation
must be available, and an adequate number of nurses
and sick-attendants must be prepared for immediate service
at the very first appearance of an infectious disease. For
the military authorities, who can scarcely perform all the
duties that the beginning of a war imposes upon them, it will
facilitate matters greatly if in future campaigns the Red
Cross devotes its attention, not only to the care of the
wounded, but also, on a larger scale than it has heretofore,
to the prevention of the outbreak and dissemination of war-pestilences.</p>

of the Division of Economics and History of the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace, appointed three Commissions to draft the
questions and problems to be dealt with by competent authorities
in all countries. The first Commission was entrusted with <cite>The
Economic and Historical Causes and Effects of War</cite>; the second with
<cite>Armaments in Time of Peace</cite>; the third with <cite>The Unifying Influences
in International Life</cite>. Subsequently the suggestions of the three
Commissions were considered and approved by the entire Conference.</p>

<p class='c007'>The questions are to be discussed scientifically, and as far as possible
without prejudice either for or against war; and their discussion
may have such important consequences that the questions are presented
below <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in extenso</span></i>.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c012'>Report of the First Commission<br /> THE ECONOMIC AND HISTORICAL CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF WAR</h3>

<p class='c013'>The Conference recommends the following researches:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Historical presentation of the causes of war in modern times,
tracing especially the influence exercised by the striving for greater
political power, by the growth of the national idea, by the political
aspirations of races and by economic interests.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Conflicts of economic interests in the present age:</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>a</em>) The influence of the growth of population and of the industrial
development upon the expansion of States.</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>b</em>) The protectionist policy; its origin and basis; its method
of application and its influence upon the relations between countries;
bounties (open and disguised, public and private); most-favoured-nation
treatment; the attitude towards foreign goods
and foreign capital; the boycott; discouragement of foreign
immigration.</p>

<p class='c038'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1002'>1002</span>(<em>c</em>) International loans; the policy of guarantees; the relations
of the creditor to the debtor States; the use of loans for gaining
influence over other States.</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>d</em>) Rivalry among States with respect to capitalist investments
in foreign countries:</p>

<p class='c039'>1. The endeavour to obtain a privileged position in banking
enterprises, in the opening and development of mines, in the
letting of public contracts, in the execution of public works, in
the building of railways (Siberian, Manchurian, Persian Bagdad
Railway, Adriatic Railway, &amp;c.); in short, the organization of
larger capitalistic enterprises in foreign countries.</p>

<p class='c039'>2. The hindering of foreign countries by convention from
executing productive enterprises on their own soil, e.g. from
building railways in their own countries.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. The anti-militarist movement, considered in its religious and
political manifestations. (Only opposition to all military organization
is here to be considered.)</p>

<p class='c007'>4. The position of organized labour and the socialists in the various
States on the questions of war and armaments.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. Is it possible to determine a special interest of individual classes
making for or against war, for or against standing armies?</p>

<p class='c007'>6. The influence of women and woman suffrage upon war and
armaments.</p>

<p class='c007'>7. The extension of obligatory military service in the different
States, in times both of war and of peace.</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>a</em>) The conditions of military service; the system of enlistment
and of general obligatory service, the actual position of aliens.</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>b</em>) The ratio of the persons obliged to render military service
to the entire population.</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>c</em>) The influence of the present system of military obligation
and the organization of armies upon warfare and upon its duration.</p>

<p class='c007'>8. The economic effects of the right of capture and its influence
upon the development of navies.</p>

<p class='c007'>9. War loans provided by neutral countries; their extent and
influence on recent warfare.</p>

<p class='c007'>10. The effects of war:</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>a</em>) Financial cost of war. The methods of meeting it: Taxation;
International Loans; External Loans.</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>b</em>) Losses and gains from the point of view of public and private
economic interests; checks to production and the destruction of
productive forces; reduction of opportunities for business enterprises;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1003'>1003</span>interruption of foreign trade and of the imports of food;
the destruction of property; shrinkage of values of property,
including securities; financial burden caused by new taxes, debts,
and war indemnities; effects upon private credit and upon
savings banks; advantages to those industries which furnish
military materials; advantages and disadvantages to neutral
countries.</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>c</em>) The effects of war upon the supply of the world with food
and raw materials, with special reference to those States which
are in large degree dependent upon other countries for such
supplies, e.g. Great Britain and Germany; by diversion of capital
from those countries which produce food and raw materials
(especially the stoppage of railway building and of new investments
in agriculture and other industries).</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>d</em>) The condition of the victorious State: manner of levy and
use of contributions and war indemnities; influence upon industry
and social life.</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>e</em>) The manner in which the energy of nations is stimulated or
depressed by war.</p>

<p class='c007'>11. Loss of human life in war and as a result of war: influence
upon population (birth-rate, relation between the sexes, ratio of the
various ages, sanitary conditions).</p>

<p class='c007'>12. The influence of war and of the possibility of war upon the
protective policy, upon banking conditions (especially upon banks
of issue), and upon monetary systems.</p>

<p class='c007'>13. The influence of annexation upon the economic life of the
annexing States, and upon the State whose territory has been annexed.</p>

<p class='c007'>14. The annexation of half-civilized or uncivilized peoples, considered
especially from the point of view of the economic interests,
which act as motive powers; the methods through which private
enterprises take root in such regions and through which they bring
influence to bear upon their own governments; the effects of such
annexations upon the development of trade with the annexing State
and with other countries, as well as upon the economic and social
life of the natives.</p>

<p class='c007'>15. The progressive exemption of commercial and industrial
activities from losses and interferences through war.</p>

<p class='c007'>16. Influence of the open-door policy upon war and peace.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>Report of the Second Commission<br /> <span class='small'>ARMAMENTS IN TIME OF PEACE. MILITARY AND NAVAL ESTABLISHMENTS. THE THEORY, PRACTICE, AND HISTORY OF MODERN ARMAMENTS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>1. Definition. Armaments might be described as ‘the preparations
made by a State either for defence or for attack’. These would
include the provision of food, financial preparations, and also semi-military
railways, canals, docks, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Causes of armaments. Motives for increasing or commencing
them, distinguishing the great from the small powers.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Rivalry and competition in armaments. Motives and consequences
of rivalry, with the possibilities of limitation.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Modern history of armaments, with special fullness from 1872.
To be noted as important landmarks:</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>a</em>) The introduction of conscription into Germany, France,
Austria, Italy, Japan, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>b</em>) Modern inventions affecting war.</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>c</em>) The question of privateering and private property at sea.</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>d</em>) Duration of military service.</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>e</em>) The traffic in arms.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. Military budgets from 1872 (distinguishing ordinary from extraordinary
expenditures).</p>

<p class='c007'>6. The burden of armaments in recent times.</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>a</em>) The proportion of military to civil expenditure.</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>b</em>) Military expenditure per capita.</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>c</em>) Military expenditure from loans in time of peace, i.e. a comparison
of expenditure from taxes with expenditure from borrowed
money.</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>d</em>) Comparative burdens of individual taxpayers in different
countries and the extent to which the differences are due to
armaments.</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>e</em>) Military pensions.</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>f</em>) It is desirable to ascertain where possible the ratio between
the total income of each nation and the total expenditure on
armament at various times.</p>

<p class='c007'>7. The effects of war preparations upon the economic and social
life of a nation:</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>a</em>) On the sustenance of the entire population of a country at war.</p>

<p class='c038'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1005'>1005</span>(<em>b</em>) On railway policy.</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>c</em>) On public administration and on social legislation.</p>

<p class='c007'>8. The economic effects of withdrawing young men from industrial
pursuits, into the army and navy:</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>a</em>) Compulsory.</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>b</em>) Of non-compulsory service (specially in the case of mercenary
troops).</p>

<p class='c039'>(Allowance being made for the industrial value of military
education and training.)</p>

<p class='c007'>9. The influence of changes in the occupations of a people upon the
composition and efficiency of armies, and the influence of the changes
in the composition of armies on the economic life.</p>

<p class='c007'>10. Loans for armaments (participation of domestic and foreign
capital).</p>

<p class='c007'>11. The industries of war, i.e. the various manufactures and other
industries which are promoted and encouraged by military and naval
establishments, distinguishing between:</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>a</em>) Government undertakings (arsenals, dockyards, &amp;c.).</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>b</em>) Private undertakings, including the history and working of
the great armament firms, which sell to foreign customers as well
as to their own governments.</p>

<p class='c007'>12. War materials (munitions of war). Their recent development
and their cost. This includes arms, ammunition, armour-plate, warships,
guns of all kinds, military airships, &amp;c. So far as possible the
effect of recent inventions upon offensive and defensive war should be
indicated.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c012'>Report of the Third Commission<br /> <span class='small'>THE UNIFYING INFLUENCES IN INTERNATIONAL LIFE</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>1. The Conference is of the opinion that the economic life of
individual countries has definitely ceased to be self-contained; and
that, notwithstanding the barriers raised by fiscal duties, it is becoming
in ever-increasing measure a part of an economic life in which the
whole world participates.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. It desires that this change be studied with the object of ascertaining
to what extent the economic life of individual nations has
ceased to be self-contained, and the causes which are bringing about
the greater interdependence of nations.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Special attention should be paid to the following factors:</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>a</em>) How far the growth of population is responsible for the
changes that have occurred and are in progress.</p>

<p class='c038'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1006'>1006</span>(<em>b</em>) The extent to which the insufficiency of the natural resources
of individual countries for their own requirements has contributed
to it.</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>c</em>) Whether the increasing economic unity of the world is
the cause or the result of the rising in the standard of living, and
how far the increasing welfare of nations has been caused by the
growing unity.</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>d</em>) In what measure the need of individual countries to obtain
materials of production from other lands and to find new markets
for their own products is responsible for the growth of international
dependence.</p>

<p class='c038'>4. The Conference desires that investigations be made into:</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>a</em>) The volume of the world’s production of all the many articles
of food, of the various raw materials, and of the principal manufactures.</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>b</em>) The productions of individual countries, and the extent to
which they are retained for home consumption or are exported.</p>

<p class='c038'>(<em>c</em>) The consumption of individual countries, and the extent to
which the various articles are supplied from home productions or
are imported.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. The Conference wishes to ascertain to what extent the economy
of production by large units, instead of by small units, has contributed
to the international dependence of nations.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. The development of this world-embracing economy has taken
place in great measure in consequence of the investment of capital
by rich countries in less developed lands. Through this there have
arisen close relations and a great increase of wealth, not only for the
lending and the borrowing countries, but for all nations. The Conference
is of the opinion that researches should be made into the
extent of the interdependence of the nations in the matter of capital.</p>

<p class='c007'>7. The Conference desires to institute inquiries into the interdependence
of the financial centres of the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>8. The Conference desires to make the unifying effects of international
trade, the building of railways, the progress of shipping,
the improvement and extension of all means of communication and
the progress of inventions, the subjects of careful investigation.</p>

<p class='c007'>9. The Conference is in favour of making a comprehensive study
of the various international unions and associations, in which the
social and economic interests of all classes of society are now either
organized or in process of organization, through official or private
action.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
